         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Gods deſigns ſhall go on whatever lies in the way to hinder. He was reſolved upon the deſtruction of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Rivers of it lay in the way, ſo that an Army could not get over <hi>Nilus</hi> that great river; if gotten over, it could not march and do the work appointed for the multitude of little Rivers were in the land; ſhall theſe hinder the deſigne of God? No, he will dry up the Rivers to make way unto his deſigns; the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſhall paſs over, and pierce through the whole land. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were at the Red Sea, that lay as an impediment unto Gods deſign, which was to carry them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but did it hinder the ſame? No, ſpeak to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they go forward; what go forward and be drowned in the Sea? No, becauſe they had not Faith to go upon the waters, therefore he divides the waters, and makes a dry path for them through the midſt of the deeps, <hi>Exod</hi> 14. There were Mountains in the way hindering the building of the Temple, but one great mountain above all the reſt. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who art thou, O great mountain?</hi> whether it were the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, or Satan and all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Jewes, God made it a plain before <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and notwithſtanding all enemies and oppoſition, he carried on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47317:16"/> the work of God. Things may be too hard for men, impoſſible for them, but nothing is too hard for, or impoſſible to the Lord. He enabled <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to take <hi>Tyrus,</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Egypt;</hi> all the Rivers thereof ſhall not hinder it, God will dry them up rather then his deſigne ſhall faile. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.15. <hi>Thou dryeſt up mighty rivers.</hi> God hath divided Seas, plained Mountains, and dryed up Rivers in our days, to make way for his deſigns, and in due time he will <hi>dry up the great River Euphrates to make way for the Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> Rev. 16.12.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, obſerve;</p>
                     <p>All Lands are the Lords, and he may diſpoſe of them to whom he will, even to the wicked; he ſold, he gave the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> who were wicked, yea the worſt of men. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Kingdoms are not ſuch excellent things as we imagine,</hi> were they ſo, they would not be given to Gods enemies.

                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a great King, and had a great Multitude of Men, Horſes, and Chariots, and conceited himſelf greater then he was; but how great ſoever he were in realitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, God orders a Prophet to ſpeak to him, and to demand a queſtion of him.

Its impoſſible that he ſhould undertake ſo long a journey as tis from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Egypt.</hi> Its more conſonant to truth, that he pen'd this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ſent it unto him by one means or other.</p>

                     <p>This was the Queſtion <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt propound to him, and it was an upbraiding queſtion, taxing him for his pride, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and vain confidences. He had like moſt Kings many Flatterers, who flattered him into a conceit that he was greater then other Kings, yea ſo great in power, that he might incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God himſelf.

                     <p>Secondly, obſerve;</p>
                     <p>God will have them told of their Sins, and taxed for them: <hi>Go ſpeak unto Pharaoh, and ſay whom art thou like in thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Thou proud Tyrant thou ſhalt fall, though thou be great, ſtrong, there is a greater then thy ſelf, and one ſtronger then thou art, who hath ſent a Prophet to tell thee of thy pride and arrogancie, and to foretell thee of thy deſtruction.

But ye believe not my word, ye cavill againſt it, and ſay, ye ſhall pine away in your ſins, that what courſe ſoever ye take, ye ſhall not live. Men are backward to believe the word of God, and deal worſe with God, then with man; they will give credit to an honeſt man upon his word, but not to God; yea, how many do believe the Devils ſuggeſtions and deluſions, who is the father of lyes, and will not believe the word of God; and what a harſh thing is it, that men will not attribute ſo much to God as to the Devil? <hi>Eve</hi> took the Devils bare word in Paradice, ſhe put not him to his oath, when he ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not dye, your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall

But men will not take Gods bare word, they put him to his oath, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Its a great thing for God to ſpeak, but more for him to ſwear; he that made the world with a word, is not believed upon his word, he muſt take his oath upon it; ſo that it ſtands God in more to be believed in the world, then it did to make the world; his ſingle word ſufficed for the one, his oath was required for the other:<note place="margin">O beatos nos quorum cauſa Deus jurat; O miſerr imos ſi nec juranti Domino credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Tertul:</hi> Si non credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus promitten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Deo, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus juranti Deo. <hi>Jerom;</hi>

Having therefore Gods word and oath, let us believe firmly, and ſtagger no more.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, God takes pleaſure rather in their converſion and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then in their death and deſtruction; <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked-turn from his way and live.</hi> If a State ſay to a company of its Subjects, who are Traytors, and upon trayterous deſigns, I have no pleaſure in your wayes which lead unto death, but my pleaſure is that you turn from them and live; is not here a large door of hope opened unto them, whatever their Treaſons be?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Leaſt men being deeply guilty, ſhould ſuſpect the reallity of God herein (for guilt is full of jealouſies) the Lord ſweares to it, and that by his life, which is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable thing of all (for none doubts whether he be the living God) <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord; I have no pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Thirdly, Here is Gods command and earneſt deſire of their turning, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evill wayes.</hi> When a mans ſervant is abroad in ſome dangerous deſign, and his Maſter commands him again and again to leave it off, and come home to him; or if the ſervant be in a deep water, and the Maſter ſees he will be drown'd if he come not back again, he calls to him, and commands him to return; is not this an argument that he ſeeks his good, and would have him ſafe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God ſets the ſtrongeſt arguments before them that can be thought of, life and death. If ye go on, there is no hope of mercy, you muſt dye; if you will turn, here is life, ye ſhall live, here is great mercy. They are not left unto uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, whether they ſhall have life or no; but life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and offered unto them, and where that is promiſed there is a wide door of mercy opened; God is troubled at it, that ſinners forſake mercy and embrace it not: <hi>Why will ye dye? Why will ye not turn from your evill wayes unto me the living God? Am I ſo ill a God? Have I dealt ſo unkindly with you, as that you will not come unto me; teſtifie againſt me, tell me wherein.</hi> Like that in <hi>Micah</hi> 6.3. <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearyed thee? teſtifie againſt me.</hi> If there be any ſuch thing lye in the way, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to remove it.</p>

                        <hi>Turn ye, turn ye.</hi> God at firſt made man upright, with his face towards himſelf, but he ſought out inventions, and turn'd away from God to the creature, which was a madneſſe, to leave an univerſal, everlaſting, and ſatisfying good, for a particular fading, and an unſatisfying good; this madneſs is in the hearts of all men,<note place="margin">Eccl: 9.3.</note> till they come to repenting &amp; turning again unto God, and ſetting him in his right poſture to behold the Lord.

                        <hi>Wicked men are apt to complain of, and carp at the wayes of God.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſaid the way of the Lord is not equall.</hi> Job 21.15. <hi>What is the Allmighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him?</hi> We get nothing by his ſervice, by calling on his name, he is a hard Maſter, he regards not our labour or prayers. Theſe were of the ſame ſpirit with them in <hi>Malachie's</hi> dayes, who bluſht not to ſay, <hi>Its in vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoaſts?</hi> Mal. 3.14. We were told that no ſervice was like unto the Lords, that thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47317:75"/> ſhould be bleſſed and live comfortably, but we find no ſuch thing: we have tryed him, and find that he regards, exalts, and bleſſes thoſe that never minded him or his wayes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. therefore <hi>Its in vain to ſerve him.</hi> In the 5. of <hi>Jeremy</hi> is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inſtance to this purpoſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>The houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah have dealt very treacherouſly againſt me, ſaith the Lord. They have belyed the Lord, and ſaid, it is not he, neither ſhall evill come upon us, neither ſhall we ſee ſword nor famine: And the Prophets ſhall become wind, and the word is not in them.</hi> They ſaid God had no reaſon to threaten them with ſword or famine, they deſerved no ſuch judgement at his hands; and therefore the Prophets that propheſied ſuch things, were not ſent of God, his word was not in them, they brought windy doctrines of their own, and ſhould together with their doctrines, become wind; evill ſhall not come upon us, but upon them. When Chriſt was on earth, how did the Scribes and Phariſees carp at him, his wayes, and doctrine? ſee <hi>Matth:</hi> 12.22. <hi>John</hi> 5.10.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.48. <hi>Cha:</hi> 10.32, 33. In our dayes do not men carp at the Scriptures, Ordinances, Providences and diſpenſations of God? Such is the pride and arrogancy of man, that he dares blame and condemn the wayes and things of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Men have no cauſe to complain of, or cavill againſt the wayes of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His wayes are equall, juſt, righteous, however they appear to men; he is God, and cannot do unjuſt things; <hi>He is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. <hi>Juſt and true are his wayes,</hi> Rev: 15.3. <hi>He is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. <hi>The juſt Lord is in the midſt of the City, he will not do iniquity,</hi> Zeph: 3.5. <hi>Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen: 18.25. Yes, though men do wickedly, God will not. <hi>Habak:</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evill, and canſt not look on iniquity;</hi> he cannot look on it to approve it, much leſſe to act it.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:47317:76"/>
                     <p>Secondly, Our wayes are unequall; and ſhall the guilty complain of the innocent? Had the <hi>Sodomites</hi> any cauſe to complain of God, who were ſo wicked? Had the old world which was ſo corrupt, cauſe to cry out of Heaven which was pure? No man hath juſt ground to quarrel againſt Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, when himſelf walks unevenly before God, and his paths are crooked. If juſt men ſin and ſtep aſide; <hi>Eccl:</hi> 7.20. <hi>What do wicked men? they are altogether out of the way, Pſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>They do no good,</hi> their lives are a conſtant ſinning, or a continued ſin, and ſhould God puniſh him daily for ſo doing, he had no juſt cauſe to fault the Lord; <hi>Lament:</hi> 3.39. <hi>Wherefore doth a l ving man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Upon comparing of his dealings with the righteous falling to commit iniquity, and the wicked turning from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it appears to all unprejudiced men who are not blinded with iniquity; the one is puniſhed for his apoſtacy, the other is pardoned upon his repentance; judgement is the portion of the one, &amp; mercy the portion of the other. If God ſhould puniſh the repenting wicked man, and ſpare the apoſtatized righteous man, then there were cauſe of complaint; but its contrary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his wayes are equall, and there is no cauſe to complain of them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God hath power over the ſons of men, they are his family, and he may exerciſe Diſcipline in his family; <hi>the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> were Gods houſe, he Maſter of that family, and when any ſin'd in it, he had power to correct them, or turn them out of dores, and who ſhould fault him? it is not childrens duty to complain of their Parents, nor for ſervants to complain of their Lord and Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Complaints in this kind will do us no good, they will harm us rather, for God is judge, yea the higheſt judge, and will not only judge us for our other evill wayes, but for this very way of charging him to be unjuſt, and cavilling at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; he will judge every one after his wayes, neither great nor ſmall can avoide his judgement. Let us all therefore take heed how we fault the wayes of God, how ſtrange or grievous ſoever they appear or be unto us.</p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47317:76"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When men have once taken up prejudice againſt God and his wayes, its not eaſie to be remov'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> had drunk in this conceit, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>That the wayes of God were not equall;</hi> and much of that Chapter is ſpent in proving the contrary, to extirpate that miſ-conceit; but it took not effect, they let paſſe Gods Arguments, whereby he cleared himſelf, and carryed along with them their prejudice againſt him and his wayes, as appears in this Chap: <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. &amp; 20. <hi>Yet ye ſay, The way of the Lord is not equall.</hi> When weeds are gotten into the ground, and rooted there, its not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to cleanſe that ground from them; when errors, deluſions, corrupt opinions, and prejudice againſt the truth, are gotten into the head or heart, its not an eaſie thing to get them out. Many wonder that Miniſters ſhould not convince unlearned and weak men of their errors, and take them off from their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and prejudices, but they ſhould conſider ſome men will not be convinced, either by God or man. Theſe here were not convinced by God; nor the Phariſees by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.6, 7. &amp; 10. Chap: nor the <hi>Athenians</hi> by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.</p>

                     <p>It was commanded before the Law was given, <hi>That they ſhould not eat bloud,</hi> Gen: 9.4. Levit: 19.26. That is, neither bloud let out from the fleſh, nor bloud with the fleſh; one reaſon is given, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Ye ſhall eat the bloud of no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fleſh, for the life of all fleſh is the bloud thereof;</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is <hi>Nepheſh,</hi> the ſoul of all fleſh is the bloud thereof. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſh</hi> is put ſometime for the whole man, as <hi>Gen:</hi> 46.26. <hi>All the ſouls of the houſe of Jacob,</hi> that is, all the perſons; ſometimes for the more noble part of man, <hi>viz:</hi> the reaſonable ſoul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul;</hi> Sometimes for the affections, as <hi>Deut:</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul;</hi> Sometimes for the life, as <hi>Iſa:</hi> 53.12. <hi>He hath poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> that was his life, John 10.15. and ſo its rendred and to be taken in the place cited; the life of all fleſh is the bloud thereof; bloud properly is not the life or ſoul of fleſh, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47317:81"/> the life or ſoul is ſaid to be in the bloud, or bloud, <hi>Propter ſpiritus vitales &amp; animales, qui animae organa, &amp; virtutis ejus vehicula ſunt, &amp; ſanguine evaporant.</hi> Another reaſon why they might not eat bloud,<note place="margin">Duet. in Gen: cap. 9.4.</note> is in the 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that Chap. <hi>I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for your ſouls; for it is the bloud that maketh an atonement for the ſoul.</hi> The bloud being to be offered upon the Altar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the bloud of Chriſt, which was to be ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. and therefore not to be eaten. A third reaſon was, that they might not be cruell and bloudy minded, but might in a ſpecial manner take heed of ſhedding mans bloud, which is the ground of the prohibition, <hi>Gen:</hi> 9.4, 5. But they minded neither the prohibition it ſelf, nor the reaſons of it, they did eat with the bloud, that is, they did eat the fleſh with the bloud in it, or they did eat the bloud drawn out from the fleſh.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That men may be much affected with hearing the Prophets and Preachers of God, and yet be vile hypocrites, very wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe men that flocked to hear <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and unto whom he was <hi>as a very lovely ſong, as a ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voyce, and can play well on an inſtrument,</hi> they were backbiters &amp; covetous; there was none in <hi>Babylon</hi> pleaſed them like <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Come, come let us go and hear Ezekiel;</hi> they were as much taken with him, as any are with muſick, with pleaſant voices, tunes and ſongs, which oftentimes raviſh the hearers; yet they were unſound at heart, the word did them no good, they amended not their lives, they parted not with their luſts. In Chriſts time, the people flocked to hear him, were affected with him, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.37. <hi>The common people heard him gladly;</hi> &amp; Chap: 14.43. <hi>Judas and a great multitude with him, came to take Chriſt, and laid hands on him, verſ.</hi> 46. &amp; <hi>Chap:</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>The multitude cryed, Crucifie, crucifie him.</hi> Many of them that heard him gladly before, were much affected with his Heavenly Doctrine, now cryed out <hi>crucifie him,</hi> and ſo ſhewed what vile hypocrites they were. In our dayes ſome Preachers are as a pleaſant ſong to ſome perſons; they are affected with their voice, notions, geſtures, expreſſions, matter, arguments, ſtories; they ſigh, they weep ſometimes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47317:94"/> and are raviſhed at other times, they never heard ſuch a man, ſuch a Sermon, ſuch things, and yet are not changed in their hearts, reformed in their tongues or lives, but are notorious hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When people hear the Preacher, and do not practice what is taught, the word is no more to them then a ſong, or a fit of muſick, nor the Preacher more then a Muſician or Fidler unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou art unto them as a lovely ſong of one that can play well on an inſtrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</hi> Theſe words are a proof and reaſon of the former. Should we tell people, You eſteem the word preached no more then an idle, amorous, witty, ſcurrilous ſong, nor the Preacher any more then he that ſings ſuch a ſong, they would think themſelves much wronged; but it is ſo in Gods account, when they hear the Preacher, and do not practice what they hear: A fit of muſick affects for the preſent, but quickly paſſes away, and both the muſick and the man are forgotten; ſo is it here, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are affected ſomewhat at a Sermon, but Sermon and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are quickly forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hearing of the word is good, but not to be reſted in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are not blam'd for hearing, that is a duty belongs to all; <hi>James</hi> 5.19. But they reſted in their hearing; they made not the <hi>word a Lamp unto their feet, and a light unto their paths,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 119.105. They did not meditate on it, digeſt it, turn it <hi>in ſuccum &amp; ſanguinem,</hi> into good nouriſhment, that ſo they might expreſs the virtue of it in their lives; they heard the word, and that was all; of ſuch that is verified, <hi>Matth:</hi> 13.13. <hi>Hearing they hear not.</hi> The word hath no influence into them, impreſſion upon them, expreſſion from them; they are no better then thoſe that never heard; they are like men that obſerve wind and tide, but never make a voyage. 2 Tim:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47317:94"/> 3.7. <hi>There were women ever learning, but never attained to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> and many are ever hearing, and never come to practice. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.</hi> They had heard Chriſt, reſted in their hearing, and that was their undoing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God expects men ſhould be not only hearers, but doers alſo of his word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They hear thy words, but they do them not.</hi> Hearing alone pleaſes not God; he gave not his word to be heard only, but to be heard and practiced; they are good hearers <hi>qui verba vertunt in opera,</hi> who turn words into actions, <hi>James</hi> 1.22. <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi> He tells them they deal fallaciouſly, they baffle and delude themſelves, not others, if they hear the word, and do it not; though there be power in the word to ſave your ſouls, yet if ye be not doers of it, ye deceive your ſelves, and will loſe your ſouls; <hi>Matth:</hi> 7.26, 27. <hi>Every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them not, ſhall be likened unto a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, which built his houſe upon the ſand, and the rain deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> He that hears Chriſts Heavenly Doctrine and doth not practice it, is not built upon the rock, but upon the ſand; and when the tryall comes, will be deceived of his expectation, his houſe will down, his ſoul will be loſt. It is not hearing, it is not crying, Lord, Lord, that will open a door for a man to enter into Heaven by; <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> Not any one which goes no further: <hi>But he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. My father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath made known his will;</hi> he would have men do his will, and then he will open unto them, and let them into Heaven. Its not mens hearing or ſaying, but their doing what they hear, which pleads ſtronglyeſt for their entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. Many men commend the Preacher, the Word with their tongues, but diſgrace both with their lives: The beſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47317:95"/> commenders of the Preachers and their doctrine are mens lives, when they are doers of the word; <hi>Matth:</hi> 25.21. Its <hi>well done thou good and faithfull ſervant, enter thou into thy maſters joy:</hi> Not well heard, or well ſaid, but <hi>well done.</hi> Let us ſee to it, that we be not hearers only, but doers of the word.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The judgements threatned by the Prophets of God, ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When this cometh to paſſe (lo, it will come.)</hi> He means the ſword, wilde beaſts, peſtilence, utter deſolation, which were threatned: It ſeem'd ſomewhat unlikely, that after a war, a few poor people left in waſtes, holes, caves, forts, woods, &amp; fields, ſhould be cut off; but the Lord had ſaid it, and he did effect it. How improbable or impoſſible ſoever things appear to us, what God threatens by his Prophets to doe (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance intervene) he will accompliſh.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whatever the thoughts of wicked ones are for the preſent of the Prophets, the time will come when they ſhall have other kind of thoughts of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When this cometh to paſſe, then ſhall they know,</hi> &amp;c. When the ſword, wilde beaſts, peſtilence, utter deſolation are upon them and the Land, when they are in ſtraits, in the jawes of death, then they will have other apprehenſions of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> then now they have: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> at preſent is a <hi>lovely ſong, like a man that hath a pleaſant voice,</hi> ſome affect him, ſome ſcoff at him, others cenſure him; but when death is before them, then their thoughts will alter, then they will ſay, <hi>Ezekiel told us of theſe things that are come upon us, and how to avoid them, he call'd upon us to conſider our wayes, to turn from all our iniquities, and to provide for our ſouls; we then ſlighted him, only gave him the hearing of what he ſaid, but now we ſee he was a Prophet of God, delivered weighty things, and we were fools that we hearkened
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47317:95"/> not unto him, doing what he ſaid.</hi> When young men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all the Preachers ſay againſt whoredom and wanton courſes, come to be in years, find their fleſh and bodies to be conſumed, then will they have other thoughts of them and what they preached, then will they ſay, <hi>How have we hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and our hearts deſpiſed reproof? we obeyed not the voyce of our Teachers, nor inclined our ears to them that inſtructed us,</hi> Prov. 5.11, 12, 13. There were Prophets amongſt us, who ſought our good, who tendred mercy and many precious truths unto us, but we were ſo blinded with our luſts, ſo conceited of our own wayes, that we rejected them, and whatever they tendred us.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Prophets will be witneſſes at laſt againſt diſobedient hearers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall know that a Prophet hath been amongſt them.</hi> They heard <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but did not what he ſaid; his perſon, his doctrine, did at laſt bear witneſs againſt them. Where-ever the Lord ſets a faithful preacher, who takes pains among the people, declaring the mind of God unto them, and they do not practice what they are taught, that Preacher will riſe up in judgement againſt them; his doctrine, his prayers, tears, drops of ſweat, his life, his ſufferings, reproaches, death, will all be witneſſes againſt them. If the ruſt of mens ſilver and gold will be witneſſes againſt them, and eat their fleſh like fire, <hi>James</hi> 5.3. becauſe they let their ſilver and gold lye by them, and did not improve the ſame for publique good, and in charitable uſes, how much more will the truths of God which the Preachers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto them, (being neglected, and not improved to the good of the hearers and others) bear witneſs againſt them, and eat their fleſh, yea, their ſouls like fire? Thouſands who have flocked after Miniſters to hear them, will find thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters witneſſes againſt them, becauſe they heard them only, and never did what they heard. What a multitude of witneſſes will <hi>London</hi> and <hi>England</hi> have againſt them at the latter day? All the Godly faithful Miniſters whoſe doctrine hath been heard, but never obeyed.</p>

                     <head>That do feed themſelves, ſhoold not the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds feed the flock?</head>
                     <p>Here was their ſin, they fed themſelves, not the flock; thoſe are Shepherds in State or Church, are ſet up for the good of the people, to benefit and advantage them, not to ſeek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to draw from the people what they can to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great; they ſhould be content with their allowance, and lay out themſelves fully and wholly for the good of them that are committed to their truſt.

                     <p>The word for <hi>Flock,</hi> is <hi>Tzon,</hi> which ſignifies a multitude of Sheep or Goats. The Septuagint render it <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Sheep,</hi> and in a metaphoricall ſenſe its put for the people, <hi>Zech:</hi> 9.16. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.14. People are reſembled unto Sheep.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Sheep are fooliſh, ſilly creatures, not like Foxes, Lyons, Lybards, which are ſubtle and crafty; ſo are people for the generality of them. <hi>Jerem:</hi> 5.21. <hi>Hear now this, O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people, and without underſtanding, which have eyes and ſee not, which have ears and hear not.</hi> They had no ears to hearken unto the word of God, no eyes to ſee the hand of God, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to diſcern the mind and dealings of God; ſo <hi>Deut:</hi> 32.28. <hi>They are a Nation void of counſell, neither is there any underſtanding in them;</hi> they act like fooliſh ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that know nothing of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sheep are apt to go aſtray, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 1.7.20. <hi>David left the Sheep with a Keeper;</hi> he knew they would wander, had
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47317:98"/> they not a Keeper: ſo people are apt to ſtray from that that is juſt and equall, to turn aſide from the wayes of God. <hi>Iſa:</hi> 53.6. <hi>All we like Sheep are gone aſtray;</hi> &amp; <hi>Jerem:</hi> 2.13. <hi>My people have forſaken me the fountain of living waters;</hi> that is, They have forſaken me their Shepherd, who provided all good things for them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When one Sheep goes out of the way, many follow, run after that one; ſo it is with the multitude. 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 20.1, 2. One <hi>Sheba the ſon of Bichri, a Benjamite, blew a Trumpet, ſaying, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe; every man to his Tents O Iſrael. So every man of Iſrael went up from after David, and followed Sheba the ſon of Bichri.</hi> Here was a Ram led all <hi>Iſrael</hi> into rebellion. So <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſtept out of the way, and preſently 400 others joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto him; <hi>And Judas of Galilee drew much people after him,</hi> Acts 5.36, 37.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They are ſubject to many diſeaſes, and apt to infect one another. Its obſerved that of all creatures a man, an Horſe, and a Sheep are ſubject unto moſt diſeaſes, and quickly doth one Sheep communicate his infection unto another; ſo people are ſubject to many diſtempers, ſeditions, inſurrections, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, errors, hereſies, ſuperſtition, idolatry, and what not? <hi>Ezek:</hi> 2.3. <hi>The children of Iſrael are a rebellious Nation;</hi> Jer: 6.28. <hi>They are all grievous revolters, they walk with ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they are braſſe and iron, they are all corrupters;</hi> one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

                     <p>The Septuagint, Vulgar, and French have it, <hi>Ye eat the milk:</hi> The Hebrew word is <hi>Chelef,</hi> which ſignifies fat, becauſe its made of Milkine fatneſs; what they feed upon hath a fatty milkineſs in it which turns to fat.

                     <p>The third thing is brokenneſs; ſome Sheep had their fleſh torn by Dogs, or Buſhes, their leggs and other bones about them, broken, or put out of joynt; divers amongſt them had broken eſtates, broken ſpirits, and none bound them up. The

A good Shepherds care and delight is to feed his flock, and manifeſt it by ſtrengthning the weak, by healing the ſick, by binding up the broken, by bringing back what is gone aſtray, and by ſeeking up what is loſt; theſe Shepherds did none of theſe things. The State Shepherds neglected the flock, the Church Shepherds did ſo, the weak were not ſtrengthned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Harſh and cruel uſage of the flock; <hi>With force and cruelty have ye ruled them.</hi> Theſe Shepherds did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the weak and ſtrong, the ſound and ſick, and ſo rule them wiſely, gently, compaſſionately, but they were rough, rigid, bitter and cruel unto them. The politicall Shepherds ſhut up the doors of the Temple, and would not let them come in to ſacrifice or worſhip there, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 28.24. They compelled the people to ſerve idols, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.11. They revolted from under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and ſo brought wars and heavy taxes upon the people, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 17.15. <hi>The Princes in the midſt of Jeruſalem were like Wolves ravening the prey, to ſhed bloud, and to deſtroy ſouls, to get diſhonest gain, Ezek:</hi> 22.27. The Eccleſiaſtical Shepherds alſo ruled after their own wills; the Prophets were roaring Lyons ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening the prey, they devoured ſouls, they took the treaſure and precious things, they made many widdows in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Prieſts violated the Law of God, and ſo wronged
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47317:102"/> the people, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 22.25, 26. The Prophets and Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together to tyrannize over the people, who were ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, that they were content to have it ſo, <hi>Jerem:</hi> 5.31. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſely, and the Prieſts bare rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi> The word for <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule</hi> is <hi>i jrdu,</hi> which imports rigorous dealing; they took too much upon them, which you may ſee <hi>Jerem:</hi> 26.8. <hi>The Prieſts and the Prophets took Jeremy, ſaying, thou ſhalt ſurely dye:</hi> They were bitter enemies to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and thoſe believed his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. <hi>Jer:</hi> 50.6. <hi>My people hath been loſt ſheep, their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds have cauſed them to go aſtray,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Such is the condition of Gods flock here, that it hath need of Shepherds to look after it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be in it ſome diſeaſed or infirm, ſome ſick, ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſome driven away, ſome ſtragling and in danger of looſing. Gods ſheep are ſubject to many evills, diſtempers and dangers, to vain cuſtomes, <hi>Jer:</hi> 10.3. to bruiſing and breaking, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.14. to hunting like wilde beaſts, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 13.18. to beating and grinding to pieces, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 3.15. to devouring, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. to errors, hereſies, corrupt opinions and practices, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. to backſliding, <hi>Jer:</hi> 8.5. to miſtakes and all ſorts of evills, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 5.20. Its mercy, yea great mercy, that God hath appointed Shepherds for his flock, Civill and Spiritual, to provide for the weakneſſes, maladies, and dangers of the ſoul, as well as of the body.—Where theſe be wicked, it goes ill with the flock; if they be ſelfiſh, negligent, rigid in ruling, the flock will ſuffer much: O pray unto God earneſtly, that he would give us good Shepherds. There is a choice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or two in <hi>Jer:</hi> 23.4. <hi>I will ſet up ſhepherds over them which ſhall feed them, and they ſhall fear no more, nor be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither ſhall they be lacking.</hi> And <hi>Jer:</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will give you Paſtors according to mine heart, which ſhall feed you according to knowledge and underſtanding.</hi> Theſe promiſes ſpeaks of good Shepherds for State and Church: Let us improve them, and preſſe God for the fulfilling of them.</p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:47317:102"/>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That wicked Magiſtrates and Miniſters, in Gods account, are as no Magiſtrates, no Miniſters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They were ſcattered becauſe there is no ſhepherd.</hi> There were many Shepherds in the State, and many in the Church, yet all theſe were as none, becauſe they were wicked, ſought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, fed not the flock, but ruled with cruelty; when Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds degenerate ſo far, as to be contrary to what they ſhould be, then they are as none before God. Such, in <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.17. are called <hi>idoll ſhepherds;</hi> idols are nothing, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 8.4. and ſo were they as nothing in the ſight of God, and when it is ſo, then the ſheep are ſcattered.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as God eyes the great ones in State or Church, ſo he deals impartially with them being wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He obſerved what Magiſtrates and Miniſters did in their places, and ſeeing them ſelfiſh, negligent, cruell, he threatens them all; <hi>Wo to the Shepherds of Iſrael;</hi> he ſaw they were all guilty of grievous ſins, amended not after his long-forbearing them, and therefore without reſpect denounces judgement againſt them. God is greater then the greateſt, and fears not the faces of Princes or Prophets; let them have what pretences they will to colour their wayes, the Lord diſcernes them; let them be never ſo terrible unto men, the Lord will be a terrour unto them; let them continue in their wickedneſs never ſo long, at laſt God will be avenged on them.</p>

                     <head>And I will ſet up one ſhepherd over them.</head>
                     <p>Some make this ſhepherd to be <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who came of the Race of <hi>David,</hi> and brought the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> into their old paſtures again, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they had their Temple, Worſhip, and Ordinances, as in former dayes; but if we conſult Chap: 37.24, 25. where he ſpeaks of the ſame perſon, you ſhall find things there incompetent to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and muſt refer unto Chriſt; and the things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned here, were not fulfilled in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> dayes. By <hi>Shepherd</hi> is meant the Lord Chriſt, who is frequently ſo called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.25. <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Zech:</hi> 13.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. and not ſimply a Shepherd; But</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The true Shepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10.2. <hi>He that entereth in by the door is the Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> that is the true ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and diſchargeth that truſt committed unto him moſt faithfully.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The good ſhepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10.11, 14. Never any like him for goodneſs, he laid down his life for his ſheep, he knew them exactly, and was ſo converſant with them that they knew his voice; he took not away from, but gave fleeces unto his ſheep, and ſupplyed all their wants.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The great ſhepherd, yea that great ſhepherd of the ſheep, <hi>Heb:</hi> 13.20. He made the ſheep, he owns the ſheep; he hath more and greater Flocks, then any other ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47317:114"/> in the world, <hi>he ſtands and feeds them in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the Majeſty of the name of the Lord his God,</hi> Micah 5.4.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The chief ſhepherd, 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 5.4. He ſets all others over his flock, and they are under him, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.28. <hi>Eph:</hi> 4.11. They are ſheep, he is head of the Church, <hi>Eph:</hi> 1.22. and their ſhepherd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> who was a Prophet and a King, both an Eccleſiaſtical and a Political Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, One ſhepherd, as here: One either in oppoſition to the multitude they had before, which wrong'd the Flock, <hi>Jer:</hi> 12.10. <hi>Many Paſtors have deſtroyed my Vineyard, they have troden my portion under foot;</hi> of which ſort Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 10.8. <hi>All that ever came before me are Thieves and Robbers.</hi> Or One, that is, the firſt or only Shepherd, unto whom none is comparable, the only wiſe ſhepherd that gave out living and effectual truth, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 12.11. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads, and as nailes faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſemblies, which are given from one ſhepherd;</hi> that is, from Chriſt, the only ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; all the Maſters of Aſſemblies had their words from Chriſt, which ever did any ſouls good.</p>
                     <p>This ſhepherd did not intrude himſelf into the office, but was call'd and ſent of God, <hi>I will ſet up;</hi> The <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe</hi> is, <hi>I will raiſe up one Governour over them, and he ſhall govern them.</hi> This expreſſion of <hi>ſetting up,</hi> is in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſet out by <hi>giving,</hi> John 3.16. by <hi>ſending,</hi> Gal: 4.4. by <hi>ſealing,</hi> John 6.27.</p>

                     <p>This word <hi>feed</hi> notes the whole office of a ſhepherd, which is briefly ſet out, verſ: 4. <hi>viz: Strengthning the diſeaſed,</hi> or <hi>weake, healing the ſick, binding up the broken, bringing back that which was driven away, ſeeking up that which was loſt, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47317:115"/> ruling gently.</hi> Others make theſe things the compleat office of a ſhepherd, viz: <hi>providing good and wholeſome paſtures for them, bringing back thoſe that go aſtray, keeping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The difference between this ſhepherd and all others.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is an univerſall ſhepherd, all flocks are his. God ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. <hi>The Cattel upon a thouſand Hills are mine;</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The flocks in a thouſand Countries are mine; the Churches in Judaea, Galilee, and Samaria,</hi> Acts 9.31. <hi>The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Syria and Cilicia,</hi> Acts 15.41. <hi>The Churches in Aſia,</hi> Rev: 1.11. <hi>The Churches of Macedonia,</hi> 2 Cor: 8.1. <hi>The Churches of Galatia,</hi> 1 Cor: 16.1. <hi>The Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> Rom: 16.4. are all called the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Rom:</hi> 16.16. They had their particular Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, but Chriſt was the univerſal Paſtor; <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles, Peter</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but Chriſt was the Apoſtle and Shepherd of both, therefore ſaith <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>That he hath other ſheep which he muſt bring to his fold,</hi> meaning the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a ſhepherd that feeds them with ſuch meat and drink, as other Shepherds cannot, they may feed them with knowledge and underſtanding, <hi>Jer:</hi> 3.15. but beſides this Chriſt feeds them with his fleſh and bloud, <hi>John</hi> 6.51, 53, 54, 55. <hi>Math:</hi> 26.26, 28. he feeds them with his Spirit, <hi>John,</hi> 16.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He inables all other Shepherds to diſcharge the truſt committed to them. Thoſe that are over his flocks, he gave them their gifts, their graces, their power, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they received of him; therefore <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap: 50.4. ſaith, <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that I ſhould know to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Iſaiah</hi> who was one of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſhepherds, had all his wiſdome, skill and power from the Lord Chriſt: And when he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47317:115"/> ſent out his twelve Apoſtles, Matth: 10.8. he told them, <hi>they had freely received, and muſt freely give;</hi> no Shepherds give ought to Chriſt, he communicates all to them, John 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing;</hi> but Chriſt could do all without them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is an abiding, an everlaſting, unchangeable Shepherd. Other Shepherds are flitting hither and thither, and at laſt dye and leave the Flock; Chriſt doth not ſo, he dyed for the Flock, but was brought again from the dead, <hi>Heb:</hi> 13.20. and lives for ever, making interceſſion for his Flock, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.25. he ſtands on Mount <hi>Zion, Rev:</hi> 14.1. beholding and feeding them daily; he walks in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks, <hi>Rev:</hi> 2.1.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Chriſt knows which are Sheep, and which are Goats, <hi>John</hi> 10.3, 14, 26, 27. others do not.</p>

A ſervant is one who is under another, and who keeps and doth things commended to him by his Maſter; Chriſt as man, was under his Father, and kept his commandements, <hi>John</hi> 15.10.

                     <p>Whether this propheſie be fullfill'd is queſtionable; there is ſomewhat in the Goſpel may make us conceive it is, for <hi>Matth:</hi> 2.2. its ſaid, <hi>where is he that is born King of the Jews?</hi> and Matth: 21.5. <hi>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, behold, thy King cometh unto thee;</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>God hath exalted him to be a Prince and a Saviour:</hi> and Rev: 1.5. He is ſtiled <hi>Prince of the Kings of the earth;</hi> theſe Scriptures evince that Chriſt is a King, a Prince, but not that he reigned as a Prince among them, for he profeſſes that he came not to Reigne but to ſerve, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. and therefore waſhed his Diſciples feet, <hi>John</hi> 13.12. and when they would make him a King, he would not, <hi>John</hi> 6.15. Chriſt hath appeared fully in his Prieſtly, and Propheticall Office, and hath had the honour of them; but he hath not appeared in his Kingly Office, nor had the honour of it; therefore its conceived this propheſie is not yet fulfilled, but that the time is to come wherein he ſhall reign as a Prince and King in the midſt of his people, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29, 30. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdome as my father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table, in my Kingdome.</hi> The time is coming that Chriſt ſhall reign, and keep a Table like a Prince, where his friends ſhall freely eat and drink; Chriſt ſpeaks not this of his ſpiritual Kingdome, which is now in the Churches and hearts of his people; nor of his Kingdome of glory, for there is no eating or drinking; but of his perſonall, humane Kingdome, as ſome term it; for <hi>Rev:</hi> 3.21.

                        <hi>I will ſet up a ſhepherd over them;</hi> God appointed the office and the Officer. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.28. God hath ſet ſome in the Church, 1. Apoſtles; 2. Prophets; 3. Teachers. In the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church are many Officers which God never appointed, there be Popes, Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbiſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which places were never appointed by God, and therefore have no bleſſing go along with them, but ſerve for ſecular ends, even pomp and tyrannizing over the conſciences of men.</p>

                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:47317:117"/>
                     <p>Secondly, He will govern them with gentleneſſe, and with skill; their former Shepherds did thruſt with the ſide and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and puſh with the horn; Chriſt would not do ſo, he is likened to <hi>David</hi> who was meek and gentle, 1 <hi>Chron:</hi> 28.2. <hi>Then David the King ſtood upon his feet, and ſaid, hear me my brethren, and my people:</hi> Here he expreſſed his diſpoſition and affection to his people: ſo Chriſt, he was a gentle, mild and meek Shepherd, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 40.11. <hi>David</hi> was wiſe and skilfull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72. and Chriſt orders them by judgement; he jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges between Sheep and Sheep, and deals with them according to their ages, conditions and capacities.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He will lead them in the right way; John 10.4. <hi>He goes before them, and they follow him.</hi> Chriſt never is out of the way; and where he is the leader, how can the Sheep go aſtray? <hi>Pſal:</hi> 23.3. <hi>He leadeth me in paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Whoever follows Chriſt ſhall be found in a path of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; if we follow others, we may be lead into by-wayes, therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor: 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He will keep them ſo that none ſhall be loſt, or miſcarry; he is vigilant and potent, he ſees the wolves, and lyons, when they are coming, and ſuffers them not to deſtroy his Sheep or Lambs; John 10.27, 28. <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> All the perſecuting Emperours could not pluck one Sheep out of Chriſts hand: out of the hands of other ſhepherds its eaſie to pull them, but impoſſible to pull them out of Chriſts hand; he knows its his Fathers will, that of all he hath given him he ſhould loſe nothing, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. and Chriſt will loſe nothing.</p>

                     <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>I will cut with them a Covenant of peace;</hi> the reaſon of which phraſe is this: When the <hi>Jews</hi> made Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, they uſed to take a Calf and cut it in the midſt, laying the two halves at a diſtance, and ſo paſſed between them; this was their manner of covenanting, and hence came the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>cutting a Covenant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How the Heathens made their Covenants, ſee <hi>Piſcat: in loc.

                     <p>The word for <hi>Covenant</hi> is <hi>Berith;</hi> of which, and whence it comes hath largely been ſpoken, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 16.8. Its not a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, but a Covenant of peace, which ſome interpret of external peace, plenty and proſperity which they ſhould have: but the peace here meant reacheth further then to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, its a peace concerns the ſoul, a peace procured by the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Col:</hi> 1.20. <hi>And having made peace by the bloud of his Croſſe, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi> Hence as Chriſt is call'd the <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo he is call'd our peace, <hi>Eph:</hi> 2.14. <hi>He is our peace, who hath made both one:</hi> He is the ground and foundation of peace, between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> between God and man; and the Goſpel upon this account is call'd the Goſpel of <hi>peace, Epheſ.</hi> 6.15. for Chriſt preached peace unto them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. This peace is not like the peace of the world, <hi>John</hi> 14.27. but its peace that quiets the conſcience, paſſeth underſtanding, keeps the heart, and rules in the ſoul, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5.1. <hi>Phil:</hi> 4.7. <hi>Col:</hi> 3.15.

                     <p>In the 70. years captivity, when <hi>Judaea</hi> was without inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, wild beaſts might multiply therein; theſe God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to cauſe to ceaſe, they ſhould be no more. But theſe evil beaſts were rather falſe Teachers, and Tyrants, wicked Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Eccleſiaſtical Shepherds: God would order it ſo, that theſe who were worſe then Bears, Lyons, Wolves and Foxes, ſhould be no more; and in ſtead of ſuch, he would give them good Magiſtrates and Miniſters, Jer: 23.4. <hi>I will ſet up ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds over them, which ſhall feed them, and they ſhall fear no more, nor be diſmayed.</hi> There is another conſtruction to be made of the words; namely this, <hi>That God would cauſe the wild and beaſtly diſpoſitions of men to ceaſe, and they ſhould become meek and gentle,</hi> according to that in Iſa: 11.6. where its ſaid, <hi>That in the dayes of Chriſt, the Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid.</hi> Wolves and Leopards are creatures moſt fierce and cruel, eſpecially againſt Lambs and Kids, yet God would ſo alter the nature of theſe, that they ſhould live and lye down together; he would make the moſt fierce, rugged, cruell men, to become mild and ſweet, and to converſe with them that were for diſpoſition Lambs and Kids. <hi>Junius</hi> ſenſe of the words is this, <hi>That the Lord would take away or reſtrain every hurtfull thing; he would not ſuffer his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be infeſted, or if they were, they ſhould not be damnified by thoſe infeſtations.</hi>

                     <head>And they ſhall dwell ſafely in the wilderneſſe, and ſleep in the woods.</head>
                     <p>Theſe are proverbiall ſpeeches, ſetting out the great ſecurity the Flock of God ſhould have under Chriſt: Where there are no wild beaſts in the Wilderneſs or the Woods, there the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47317:119"/> Sheep feed and reſt without all fear, they are moſt ſecure; and Gods people under the Goſpel and Chriſt, have the greateſt ſecurity. The word for <hi>ſafely</hi> is <hi>Labetach, in fiducia,</hi> or <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter,</hi> as <hi>Montanus</hi> renders it; that is, confidently, they ſhall be free from the fear of all enemies both Corporal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; <hi>Satan ſhall be cast into the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> Rev: 20.2, 3. and all other enemies brought to ſuch a condition, as that they ſhould not cauſe fear, <hi>Jerem:</hi> 23.4.

Though when the Lord Chriſt the true Meſſiah came, there was an univerſall peace through the world, it being at that time when the taxing was in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> dayes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid.</hi> Sanct: <hi>in Iſa.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 2. and though the wars after were not ſo much as before, yet I conceive there is a time when this propheſie ſhall be more fully compleated, for every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Chriſt was not fullfilled when he came in the fleſh, but many were to be fullfill'd in after times, among which this was one. The <hi>Jews</hi> were miſtaken concerning Meſſiahs coming, but not much concerning this propheſie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The infinite goodneſſe, kindneſſe, and condeſcenſion of God, who will enter into Covenant with ſinners, with any of the children of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Verily, every man at his beſt estate is altogether vanity? Pſal:</hi> 39.5. and why ſhould the Lord who is an infinite excellency, infinitely diſtanced from all creatures and vanity, enter into Covenant with man? what did he ſee in theſe <hi>Jews</hi> or in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to awaken, rouze, and draw out his heart unto ſuch a work? if ſtubbornneſs, ignorance, unbelief, idolatry, oppreſſion, and ſuch like, might induce him thereunto, theſe abounded both in <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> there was nothing but Gods own goodneſs, grace and mercy, to cauſe him ſo to condeſcend, as to make a Covenant with man, and ſuch a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47317:119"/> Covenant as a <hi>Covenant of peace.</hi> This ſhould</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Raiſe up our ſpirits and hearts to admiration, that an infinite, holy, glorious, and great God ſhould mind, converſe, and make Covenant with duſt and aſhes; Pſal: 144.3. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) what is man that thou takeſt knowledge of him? or the ſon of man that thou makeſt account of him? David</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that God ſhould take notice of, eſpecially make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſo mean a thing as man is, as himſelf was, though a King and Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Indear us greatly unto him. When high Ones ſtoop unto thoſe that are low and mean, it gains much upon their hearts, and indeares them abundantly unto them. When <hi>David</hi> condeſcended to <hi>Abigail</hi> to take her to wife, it affected her greatly, and indeared her unto him not a little, as you may ſee 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 25.41.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Make us faithful unto God. Is he pleaſed to make a Covenant with man, and ſhall not man be faithfull unto him? a wife ſhould not be unfaithful unto her husband, and break Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, though he be but a little above her; how much leſſe ſhould man break Covenant with God, who is ſo much above him. God complains in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.7. ſaying, <hi>They like Adam have tranſgreſſed the Covenant;</hi> I condeſcended to <hi>Adam,</hi> and made a Covenant with him; yea, I condeſcended to them, and made a Covenant with them, but they both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unfaithful, father and poſterity, they tranſgreſſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Cauſe us to be free and chearful in our obedience unto God: When ſo great a God ſhall ſo graciouſly condeſcend unto us, as to enter into Covenant with us, and that a <hi>Covenant of peace,</hi> ſhould it not make us run in his wayes, and ſerve him with gladneſs of heart?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That men through ſin are at diſtance from, and enmity with God.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I will make a Covenant of peace with them.</hi> What needed <hi>a Covenant of peace,</hi> if there had not been war between God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47317:120"/> and man? Man being apoſtatized from God through <hi>Adams</hi> fall, lived in enmity to God, Rom: 8.7. <hi>The carnall mind is enmity againſt God, for its not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Men by nature have carnal minds, oppoſe God, his Laws and wayes, and therefore <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.30. they are ſaid to be <hi>haters of God;</hi> and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. God is ſaid <hi>to hate them, Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.</hi> There was ſuch hoſtility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, as that there was no approach for man to God without a Mediator, and ſuch a Mediator as could make ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, being offended; <hi>Col:</hi> 1.21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.</hi> The <hi>Coloſſians</hi> as well as others, were once at a great diſtance from God, and enemies to God; and wherein lay their enmity? <hi>in their minds;</hi> and how did that appear? <hi>by wicked works;</hi> they plotted, contrived, and did ſuch things as declared them to be enemies to God, and being ſo, they durſt not appear before God. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God by Chriſt hath been pleaſed to take away this enmity, and to reconcile ſinners unto himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.18. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Its Chriſt hath paid the price of our redemption, he hath ſatisfied his juſtice fully, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us from wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 1.10. Its by Chriſt the Mediator that reconciliation is made; neither Angels nor men could do that work, it was a work for one that had more worth in him, then all Angels or men, <hi>Coloſſ:</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>It pleaſed God that in him all fullneſſe ſhould dwell, that ſo by him he might reconcile all things to himſelfe, by him, whether they be things in earth, or things in Heaven: By him</hi> is twice in the verſe that we may ſee by whom the enmity was taken away, and from whom the reconciling virtue came, even from the Lord Chriſt, whoſe bloud made the <hi>attonement,</hi> Epheſ: 2.13, 14, 15, 16. How ſhould this teach us to honour and prize the Lord Chriſt, by whom ſo difficult, ſo great and glorious a work was wrought?</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe that are received to God by the mediation of Chriſt, ſhall be preſerved from all hurtfull things, receive all good things needfull, and enjoy much ſecurity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When men are in the <hi>Covenant of peace,</hi> then God will cauſe the evill beaſts to ceaſe out of the Land, then no creatures, no enemies, no Devils ſhall do them harm, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. <hi>Pro:</hi> 16.7. <hi>Rom:</hi> 16.20. Then there will be a communication of all good things needful, <hi>they ſhall dwell in the wilderneſſe,</hi> there they ſhall have bleſſings, ſo as they ſhall not be put to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their dwellings for want, Pſal. 34.9, 10. Pſal. 23.1. Pſal. 84.11. <hi>Then ſhall they dwell ſafely in the wilderneſſe, and ſleep in the woods;</hi> nothing without or within ſhall create any fear, or cauſe any ſolicitouſneſs in them, they ſhall have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, and be as in the ſuburbs of Heaven, <hi>Jer:</hi> 23.4.</p>

                     <p>Here is a further bleſſing, <hi>viz:</hi> Conviction of the Heathens, that God is the God of that flock that hath ſuffered ſo much, and is with them: When God ſhould gather his flock out of the Countreys where it was ſcattered, ſet up one ſhepherd, <hi>even his ſervant David to be a Prince over it,</hi> make <hi>a Covenant of peace</hi> with the ſame, ſet it at liberty from all enemies, cauſe it to be in ſafety on all ſides, take away its reproach, put honour upon it, and ſatisfie it with bleſſings, temporal and ſpiritual; when theſe things were done, then ſhould <hi>they,</hi> that is, the <hi>Nations, know that the Lord their God was with them,</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> ſhould they know: By thoſe gracious acts of God, and great mercies beſtowed upon the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; as when God begun the work in the Type, bringing

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47317:154"/> return from their captivity, their bounds were more inlarged then ever before,</hi> which they clear from <hi>Iſa:</hi> 49.19, 20. <hi>Zach:</hi> 2.8, 9. And therein God did better unto them then at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.

As water waſheth all the filth out of a cloath, ſo doth the bloud of Chriſt all ſin out of the ſoul, 1 <hi>Joh:</hi> 1.7. <hi>The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> the guilt of our thoughts, words, acts, neglects; there is no ſin defiles the conſcience ſo, but the bloud of Chriſt will purge it away, <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.14. <hi>Chap:</hi> 1.3.

                     <p>The <hi>new heart,</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit</hi> comes from God; he that to the Authour of <hi>every good and perfect gift,</hi> is the Author of the ſame: Now in the working of this <hi>new heart,</hi> and <hi>new spirit,</hi> there be ſeveral Attributes of God ſet on work: As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>His infinite mercy.</hi> That he ſhould mind ſinners, who have old, rotten, filthy, hard, dead hearts within them, ſo at enmity with God, that they would pull him out of Heaven had they power to do it; for God to mind ſuch <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and make them <hi>new</hi> ſo as to affect him and his wayes, argues unſpeakable mercy, loving kindneſs ſuperabundant. It was a time of love when God ſaw <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in her bloud, and ſaid unto her <hi>live, Ezek:</hi> 10. It was infinite love, infinite mercy for him to pity <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſuch a caſe, and to ſay ſo unto her: the ſame it is when God makes of an <hi>old heart</hi> a <hi>new heart,</hi> of an <hi>old ſpirit</hi> a <hi>new ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods infinite power</hi> is imployed in this work. <hi>The making of a dead heart to live, a blind heart to ſee, an old heart and ſpirit to become new,</hi> requires an omnipotent arm. By the preaching of the word men have great convictions, ſtrong reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and are perſwaded almoſt to be Chriſtians; but thoſe convictions and reſolutions dye away, and they never come altogether to be Chriſtians, altogether to be <hi>new hearted,</hi> and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47317:169"/> 
                        <hi>new ſpirited,</hi> till the Lord put forth his allmighty power, and create <hi>new hearts and ſpirits</hi> in them; its a work of creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. And ſuch <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> are call'd <hi>new creatures, Gal:</hi> 6.15. 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Infinite wiſdome. The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it? Jer:</hi> 17.9. Its beyond the knowledge of man; it hath ſo many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, turnings, pretences, ſhifts, arguments, wiles, depths, methods, as that none but God knows it; he being <hi>infinitely wiſe;</hi> can anſwer all the objections, arguments, and ſubtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of the heart, ſo that it ſhall be ſilent. Mans heart whileſt its old, hath the cunning of the old Serpent in it, and pleads hard to keep its old principles, its old ungodly luſts, its old ignorance, its old darkneſs, its old formal wayes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, its old fleſhly confidences, its old delights and pleaſures, its old company, its old cuſtomes, its old aims and ends, which were ſelfe; it muſters up many arguments to defend theſe; and who can convince the <hi>heart</hi> of the evill of theſe, and take it off from them, but God by his <hi>infinite wiſdome?</hi> To make an <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which hath ſo many oldneſſes in it, <hi>new,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues more skill and wiſdome then dwels in any creature.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, His <hi>Infinite holineſſe and purity.</hi> When God takes an <hi>old heart</hi> which is as dark as hell, as ſtinking as any Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, <hi>Math:</hi> 23.27. an old <hi>ſpirit</hi> which is as unclean and loathſome as the Devils are; when he takes theſe, and makes them <hi>new,</hi> he ſcatters darkneſs, aboliſheth death, ſeparating filthineſſe, and inſtead thereof brings in <hi>marveilous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>A glorious life, Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>And true holineſſe, verſ.</hi> 24. which import that God is light without darkneſſe, life without poſſibility of dying, holineſſe without any ſpot or imperfection. When the wind cleanſeth the aire infected, peſtilential and ſtinking, it argues the wind is pure; when a veſſel or houſe is noyſome, and one cleanſes and ſweetens them, as not enduring them in that condition, it argues their cleanlineſſe, and if they could make them <hi>new,</hi> it would argue it much more; ſo here, God makes them <hi>new, He puts them into the fire that they may be refined, and partake of his holineſſe, Heb:</hi> 12.10. Its Gods holy arme which makes an unholy heart to become holy, and glorious in holineſſe.</p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:47317:169"/>
                     <p>The dignity and excellency of this <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> is worthy the notice.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Its that doth diſcriminate and difference a man from all others. They that have old hearts, old ſpirits, and <hi>new hearts, new ſpirits,</hi> differ as much from them, as light from darkneſſe, life from death, &amp; holineſſe from filthineſſe: a man with a <hi>new heart, a new ſpirit,</hi> is a living man, whereas others be dead, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. He is a ſeeing man, whereas others be blind, 1 <hi>Jok:</hi> 5.20. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.14. He is pure, whereas others are filthy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Tit:</hi> 1.15. Hereby a man is differenced from all profane, civill, and moral men, from all gifted men, from all hypocrites, what ſpecious forms of religion and holineſſe ſoever they have; whoever hath a <hi>new ſpirit</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſpirits, yea from the Devils who are but unclean ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It doth ennoble a man; <hi>A new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit</hi> doth not only diſtinguiſh from others, but makes more excellent then others, <hi>Prov:</hi> 12.26. <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi> Righteouſneſſe is one of the qualities in the <hi>new heart, in the new ſpirit, Eph:</hi> 4.23, 24. and that Nobilitates a man; ſuch a one is born not of blood, that is, not of the Princes and Nobles of the world, who ſtand upon their blood and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; nor of the will of the fleſh, that is, not in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way; nor of the will of man, <hi>viz:</hi> not by education and School principles; but of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.13. He is deſcended from the higheſt, the King of Kings, he is of the moſt Royal blood, even the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Others are vile, but he is precious, <hi>Jerem:</hi> 15.19. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>He is partaker of the Divine Nature, and lives the life of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It fills them where it is with <hi>new</hi> joyes. <hi>New</hi> things affect much; when the Apoſtles had <hi>new tongues</hi> given them, they were greatly affected therewith; and when men have <hi>new hearts, new ſpirits,</hi> they abound in joy: the greater the mercy, the more full the joy; If when a ſinner is converted, there be joy in Heaven, what joy is in the ſinners heart then? When Chriſt came to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and gave him <hi>a new heart, a new ſpirit, he was fill'd with joy, Luke</hi> 19. <hi>and new joyes:</hi> Before his joy was to get money by any means, and treaſure it up; now
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47317:170"/> his joy was to diſperſe, make ſatisfaction, and to give away, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. His <hi>new heart</hi> begat in him <hi>new</hi> joyes, and inabled him to joy in that he could not do not think of before without ſadneſs. So <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he had <hi>new</hi> joyes, fullneſſe of them in thoſe things he could not rejoyce in before, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyfull in all our tribulations;</hi> &amp; <hi>Chap:</hi> 12.10. <hi>He took pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes.</hi> Here's the excellency of <hi>a new heart</hi> and a <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> it fills with new joyes in God, in Chriſt, in the Promiſes, in the Saints, and inables us to <hi>rejoyce and glory in tribulations, Rom:</hi> 5.3.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It intitles us to diverſe new and excellent things: As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To the <hi>New Covenant:</hi> When a man hath a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>a new ſpirit,</hi> he hath an intereſt in the <hi>New Covenant, Jer:</hi> 31.31, 33. The law of ſin, and principles of Satan and the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, To <hi>New Names:</hi> Where there is <hi>newneſs of heart and ſpirit,</hi> there they are ſealed in their fore-heads with <hi>new Names;</hi> their Title is <hi>New Creatures,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Seed of Abraham, Iſa.</hi> 41.8. <hi>Servants of Righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Children of Light, John</hi> 12.36. <hi>Conquerours, Rom:</hi> 8.37. <hi>Gods workmanſhip, Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Kings and Prieſts, Rev:</hi> 1.6. <hi>Temples of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.16. <hi>The glory of God, Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>New born Babes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.2. <hi>His Saints, Pſal.</hi> 149.9. <hi>Veſſels of Gold and Silver,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Wiſe Virgins, Matth:</hi> 25. <hi>Heirs of Salvation, Heb:</hi> 1.14.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To a <hi>New Lord and Maſter:</hi> When their hearts were old Satan was their Soveraign, <hi>They walked according to the Prince of the aire, Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.26. <hi>His luſts they did execute, John</hi> 8.44. But having <hi>new hearts,</hi> they have a <hi>new Lord, a new Maſter,</hi> and that is the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Phil:</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul a ſervant of Chriſt:</hi> He had <hi>a new heart,</hi> and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47317:170"/> now he had a <hi>new Maſter,</hi> which was Chriſt, he would ſerve Satan no longer, <hi>but Chriſt, who dyed for ſinners, that they might live unto him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. When the <hi>hearts and ſpirits</hi> of men are <hi>new,</hi> they are dead to their old Maſters, and have <hi>new,</hi> Rom: 7.4. Chriſt is the Husband and Head of every one renewed by his grace, he is Lord and Maſter of all ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Matth:</hi> 23.8.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To a <hi>New Guard;</hi> Such have a <hi>Guard</hi> of Angels about them: before, as they were without God, ſo without the protection of his Angels, expoſed to all dangers; but having <hi>new hearts</hi> and <hi>new ſpirits,</hi> being <hi>new creatures</hi> they have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Heavenly Hoſt, not only to praiſe God for their new-birth as they did at Chriſts birth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. but to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and protect them, <hi>Heb:</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are not the Angels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> and none ſhall be ſuch, but thoſe that have <hi>new hearts</hi> and <hi>new ſpirits, for fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15.50.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To <hi>New Alliance</hi> this change is wrought in them: <hi>Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Adulterers, Drunkards, Murtherers, Lyars, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, Hypocrites, and all profane ones, they the very Devils themſelves, John</hi> 8.44. But when they have <hi>new hearts</hi> and <hi>new ſpirits,</hi> then they have <hi>new kindred;</hi> as a man that marries a woman, all her kindred becomes his; ſo here, all that have <hi>new hearts and ſpirits</hi> are his kindred who hath a <hi>new heart,</hi> he is allied unto them all, <hi>Math:</hi> 23.8. <hi>All ye are brethren.</hi> All the Saints throughout the earth, how great, how learned, how rich, how gifted or gracious ſoever they be, <hi>are all brethren;</hi> yea, the Angels are brethren unto thoſe that have <hi>new hearts, Rev.</hi> 19.10.22.9. and that which is beyond all, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is their <hi>Brother and Father; Math.</hi> 12.49, 50. <hi>Heb:</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, To the <hi>New Manſions in the City made without hands, John</hi> 14.2. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions, and I go to prepare a place for you; You have right and title to them, ye have new hearts, ye believe in God, verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>and I go to prepare and fit places for you in thoſe Manſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:47317:171"/>
                     <p>Fifthly, The excellency of a <hi>new heart</hi> is this, That it ſets an high price upon the things of God, and a low price upon the things of the world, how goodly ſoever they appear; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before the things of the world were magnified, and the things of God ſlighted. When <hi>Paul</hi> had another <hi>heart,</hi> and another <hi>ſpirit</hi> then before, <hi>then he had no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> then he did not value his great priviledges, he <hi>counted them and all things but loſſe for Chriſt,</hi> they did damnifie him rather then advantage him, and therefore lookt upon them as dung <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, things of no worth, chaffe, dirt, excrements in reſpect of Chriſt, his righteouſneſſe, and knowledge of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. all which had an excellency, and were ſo prized by <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was willing to lay down his life for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. When <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered the Apoſtles money for to have power to give the Holy Spirit, by laying on of hands, <hi>Peter</hi> in his own name, and in the name of the reſt, ſaid, <hi>Thy money per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh with thee; we value not bags of gold and ſilver, but the things of God, Acts</hi> 8.19, 20. When the Conjurers had the Devils caſt out of them, and <hi>new hearts</hi> given them, they brought forth their books which they had highly valued, and burnt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men, and ſo many they burnt as came to fifty thouſand pieces of ſilver, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. and inſtead of theſe, they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and Apoſtles. A <hi>new heart</hi> ſees excellency in ſpiritual things, and ſaith, <hi>It cannot over value them,</hi> but for other things <hi>it puts them under its feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Its excellent in that it doth really make God its end and aims at his glory in its operations; before ſelf was all, now God is all. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23, 24. <hi>Paul</hi> was told by the Spirit of God, that bonds and afflictions did abide him every where, that his life was in danger; now had not <hi>Paul</hi> been a man of a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he would have ſhifted for himſelf, and let the preaching of the Goſpel have fallen; but being ſuch an one, what ſaith he? <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelfe, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry, I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God:</hi> That was <hi>Pauls</hi> end to make known the grace of God in the Goſpel towards poor ſinners,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:47317:171"/> that ſo they partaking of that grace might give glory to God, and God be glorified by him. God and his glory were ſo in his eye, that he gave out a rule for all Chriſtians to eye and mind God and his glory in all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Its the principle of eternal life and happineſſe: When God puts life, light, and grace into the heart, and ſo makes it <hi>new,</hi> he hath begun our admiſſion into Heaven and happineſſe; this <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> are the water ſprings up into everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. They are the Eagles wings will carry you not only up to Heaven, but into Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> there be divers miſtakes; many think they have the ſame, when they have it not. There be ſeveral things which cauſe men to judge ſo.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Outward Reformation. When men ceaſe from their former lewd courſes, when they give over their drunkenneſs, whoredome, ſwearing, lying, oppreſſion, and other ſcandalous practices, they think themſelves, and are reputed of others to be <hi>new men,</hi> and ſo to have <hi>new hearts;</hi> but know, A man may have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, have changed his manners, yet retain his old heart: a Swine may be waſhed; and yet reſerve her Swiniſh nature: <hi>Herod</hi> reformed in many things, yet had an unreformed heart, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.9. The Scribes and Phariſees were whited Sepulchres, they had beautifull out-ſides, they appeared righteous unto men, but what were their hearts? were they not full of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and iniquity? <hi>Matth:</hi> 23.27, 28. Shame among men, fear of puniſhment, death, hell, terrours of conſcience, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtrength of reaſon, and hope of profits and reward, may make a man reform his life and manners, his heart being ſtill naught; a man formerly deboiſt and wicked may become a <hi>new man,</hi> and yet not have a new heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Morall virtues cauſe many to be deceived about this <hi>new heart:</hi> becauſe they are temperate, juſt, prudent, faithful to their friends, true in their ſpeeches, patient under afflictions, ſeek the publique good, not their own intereſt, are chaſte, and courteous unto all, they thereupon conclude that they have the <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit</hi> here ſpoken of; but all theſe are no more then were found in heathens; <hi>Scipio, Ariſtides,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47317:172"/> Cato, Aemilius, Lepidus, Lucretia,</hi> and others, excell'd in morall virtues. The <hi>Romane</hi> faith was in great eſteem in all the world, becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> kept their word, and made good whatever they promiſed. Many Heathens excell'd in morallities, and did virtuous actions for virtues ſake, yet they had no <hi>new hearts</hi> or <hi>ſpirits,</hi> they knew not what regeneration was, they were ſtrangers to the Life of God and Faith, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to what they had by their own induſtry, and what they did was not done according to the mind of God in his Word, and ſo referring to his glory; they ſought their own glory in all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A form of godlineſs. When men have left their old wayes of ſin, and taken up a way, or <hi>form of godlineſſe</hi> which is <hi>new</hi> to them, they imagine themſelves to be <hi>new,</hi> and to have <hi>new hearts;</hi> they read, pray, hear, meditate and worſhip God with their hearts, which they never did before, and hence they ground a <hi>newneſs</hi> in their hearts. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a <hi>form of godlineſſe</hi> at this day, yet are they caſt off of God and numbred amongſt unbelievers, <hi>Rom:</hi> 11.20. Such was their godlineſs, as perſecuted true godlineſs, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13.50. 1 <hi>Theſſ:</hi> 2.15. The Heathens had <hi>forms of godlineſſe; Plato</hi> taught men not to ſleep without repentance for their ſins; <hi>Hermes</hi> inſtructed <hi>them to pray earneſtly unto God, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for repentance to call upon him in the day, and not to forget him in the night;</hi> they worſhipped by nature, thoſe were no gods,<note place="margin">Treatiſe of Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</note> 
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. Forms of worſhip they had, though they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped blindly; <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaw further then the moſt of them, who ſaid, <hi>God muſt be worſhiped only that way which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;</hi> yet neither <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor the reſt of the Heathens had <hi>new hearts.</hi> Chriſtians have <hi>forms of godlineſſe,</hi> yet all among them have not <hi>new hearts;</hi> among Papiſts and Proteſtants are many religious, but few pious, they have <hi>the form of godlineſs, but not the power:</hi> Painted fire is not true fire, and all that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God do not worſhip him in <hi>newneſs of ſpirit;</hi> the moſt do worſhip him with old hearts.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Some are deceived upon this ground, that they have the Law in their hearts, approve of truth, make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their wayes, have peace within, and ſo determine their hearts are <hi>new.</hi> But here is a great miſtake, the Law is
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47317:172"/> in mens hearts by nature, <hi>Rom:</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>The Gentiles which had not the Law, did by nature the things of the Law, and ſo ſhewed the work of the Law written in their hearts.</hi> When they did ill their conſciences did accuſe them, and when they did well they did excuſe them, and ſo they had peace; here was nothing ſupernatural: where there is a <hi>new heart, a new ſpirit,</hi> there is ſomething ſupernatural; men have not theſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from their parents, but they are given, they are put in by God, <hi>I will give you a new heart, and I will put within you a new ſpirit.</hi> The Law that all men have in their hearts is by virtue of Creation, not of the new Covenant, that is another Law, <hi>Jer:</hi> 31.33. which is from grace, not from nature; where this Law is written, the heart is <hi>new,</hi> and ſo doth not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of truth in general, but knows <hi>and approves of truth as it is in Chriſt,</hi> Eph: 4.21. and as it is according to godlineſs. Truth in a <hi>new heart</hi> provokes unto Godlineſs, and maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious towards God and men, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>Looking at Chriſt for peace, Rom:</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God,</hi> the conſcience being purged from dead works by the bloud of Chriſt: Men have ſound peace in their <hi>new hearts;</hi> Its falſe peace which men of old hearts have, they bribe their conſciences with doing ſomething, and that is their peace.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, New Relations make ſome to fancy they have <hi>new hearts and new ſpirits;</hi> they are under Church priviledges, they are Citizens of <hi>Sion,</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in relation to Chriſt and his Ordinances, this may be, and yet without <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>ſpirit;</hi> Relations make not alterations in mens hearts. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, ſtood in relation to Chriſt and the Goſpel, yet his heart was the ſame it was before, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. The <hi>Jews</hi> gloried they were <hi>the ſeed of Abraham, John</hi> 8.33. <hi>Yet they were of their father the Devill, verſ.</hi> 44. <hi>and had bloudy hearts, verſ.</hi> 40. <hi>ſeeking to kill Chriſt, Rom:</hi> 2.28, 29. Outward priviledges may be, as Circumciſion of the fleſh, where there is no Circumciſion of the heart; and <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Gal:</hi> 6.15. <hi>That Circumciſion nor uncircumciſion avail any thing, but a new creature;</hi> they may be where the <hi>new creature</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:47317:173"/> is not; himſelf had many priviledges, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. when he was far from <hi>newneſs of heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Gifts, They breed miſtakes in divers perſons: thoſe that have choice and great gifts perſwade themſelves they have <hi>new hearts and ſpirits,</hi> that they are gracious and good; but there is a vaſt difference between gifts and grace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Gifts make not a man a Chriſtian: Heathens had great gifts, as <hi>Tully, Seneca, Plato, Ariſtotle, Plutarch;</hi> Its grace makes a Chriſtian; the Gentiles were not Chriſtians, and ſo not acceptable to God, till they were ſanctified by the Holy Spirit, <hi>Rom:</hi> 15.16. They may make a man an uſeful man, not a good man, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. Its faith and the graces of the Spirit make a good man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All gifts do ſeldome or never meet in one man, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do, they are the fruits of the Spirit, and grow all in a <hi>new heart, John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fullneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi> Graces go together, not Gifts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man may have Gifts and not be ſaved. <hi>Judas</hi> had gifts, yet was a ſon of perdition: The beaſt came up out of the earth had miraculous Gifts, and the falſe Prophets alſo, and notwithſtanding their Gifts, they were both caſt into the <hi>Lake of fire burning with Brimſtone, Rev:</hi> 13.11, 13, 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.20. But he that hath a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new ſpirit</hi> hath grace, and ſo ſhall be ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He that is born of the Spirit, is a new creature,</hi> he hath grace, and ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.11.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Activeneſs. Some men growing active for God and the publique, Zealous againſt corrupt practices in Church or State, gather from hence that they have <hi>new hearts</hi> and <hi>ſpirits;</hi> they were not ſo before, and how can it be that ſuch new ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and activeneſs ſhould be in them, and from them, and they not be men of <hi>new hearts?</hi> When men are call'd to publique imployments, they may have other hearts then they had before, yet not ſuch <hi>a new heart</hi> as is here ſpoken off. <hi>Saul</hi> had another heart, (1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10.9.) when anointed to be King, yet not a <hi>new heart.</hi> Credit, profit, and conſcience miſ-informed may make men zealous and active, when they have no other then their old hearts. <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47317:173"/> was very active and exceedingly zealous of the Traditions of his fathers, <hi>Gal:</hi> 1.13, 14. How active are Jeſuits? how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are Papiſts and many others? and that from erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their conſciences, not <hi>newneſſe of their ſpirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mens hearts and ſpirits by nature are old, they are degenerated from that innocency, ſimplicity, and purity, Adam was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, they are corrupted ever ſince he eat of the forbidden fruit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pſal. 14.1. <hi>Men are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doth good;</hi> Pſal. 53.3. <hi>Every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Such as their hearts are, ſuch are their actions; old hearts have anſwerable operations, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 58.3. <hi>They go aſtray aſſoon as they be born.</hi> They brought cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts and natures with them into the world, and their firſt actings were againſt God, truth, ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ce, and holineſſe; men by nature have hearts full of old things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Old things are not paſſed away, but abide:</hi> Old principles, old luſts, old deſires, old thoughts, old reaſonings, old enmityes, old confidences, old hardneſs, old deceitfulneſs, old froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and old naughtineſs, are all found in mens hearts till they are made <hi>new, Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Math:</hi> 15.19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A new heart, a new ſpirit, is not from the power or will of man, but from the grace of God.</hi>

                        <hi>A new heart will I give you, a new ſpirit will I put into you.</hi> God bade them (<hi>Ezek:</hi> 18.31.) <hi>make themſelves new hearts, and new ſpirits,</hi> but they were not able to do it, he promiſes therefore to do it for them. Its Gods way in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word to command and call for that at the hands of men, which he intends to give and work, as <hi>Phil:</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation;</hi> and in the next verſe its ſaid, <hi>Its God which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47317:174"/> worketh in you, both to will and to do: Iſa:</hi> 1.16. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean; Ezek:</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean: Deut:</hi> 10.16. <hi>Circumciſe the foreskin of your heart,</hi> they could not do it, therefore (<hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.) <hi>the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart.</hi> Theſe Scriptures evince, that it is the Lord himſelf who performs what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; its not mans will or power which produceth the <hi>new heart,</hi> its the gracious and mighty hand of God which effects it; and when he will work who ſhall let it? ſhall mans will? yes, if God did only propound arguments, command, exhort, invite, encourage, threaten, it might, but God doth promiſe to do the thing, <hi>To give a new heart, to put in a new ſpirit;</hi> and ſhould the liberty of mans will hinder it, how ſhould God be faithful? but rather then he will be found unfaithful, he will over-power the corrupt wills of men, and make them flexible to his will.

                     <head>The ſtony heart.</head>
                     <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>The heart of ſtone,</hi> that is, the heart which in a ſpiritual ſenſe is like a <hi>ſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, A <hi>ſtone</hi> is ſenſeleſſe, it feels or perceives nothing; and ſo is a <hi>ſtony heart, Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling;</hi> they were ſo accuſtomed to ſin, that they felt not any evill in ſin; <hi>Conſuetudo peccandi tollit ſenſum peccati. Zech:</hi> 14.4.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47317:174"/> we read of a Mountain that cleav'd in ſunder at the preſence of Chriſt; but the hearts of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo ſtony that they were not at all affected at the preſence or voice of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A <hi>ſtone</hi> is hard and impenetrable, a Knife, a Sword, a Nail, will not enter into it; ſo a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is ſo hard that the Word of God hath no entrance into it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy Words giveth light;</hi> when it enters into the heart it doth ſo; but though the Word be of a ſharp and piercing nature, yet it enters not into a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable, <hi>Zech:</hi> 7.11. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pull'd away their ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears that they ſhould not hear; yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone:</hi> No truths, no arguments, no invitations, no prayers, no tears, no mercies, no threats, no judgements, do conquer or prevail with it; neither wind, rain, thunder, lightning, ſun-ſhine, heat, cold, do change the nature of a Rock.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A <hi>ſtone</hi> is unpoliſhed and inept for building and other uſes, till it be hewn, ſawn, and brought into ſome other form; ſo a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is an heart unpoliſhed, unfit to lye in any part of Gods building, or for any ſervice of his, till it be poliſhed, hewn, ſawn, hammered, and brought into ſome other frame. As a <hi>ſtone</hi> cannot change it ſelf, no more can a <hi>ſtony heart.</hi> The Devil knew that the <hi>ſtones, Matth.</hi> 4.3. could not turn themſelves into bread, therefore ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Command that they be made bread.</hi> He knew they might be made bread meet to eat; and ſo <hi>ſtony hearts,</hi> though they cannot make themſelves fleſhy, yet they may be made fleſhy, they may be brought to another form, and ſo be fit for ſpiritual imployments and uſes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A <hi>ſtone</hi> doth reſiſt and repell what falls upon it; <hi>ſtones</hi> do oft break the inſtruments ſtrikes them, and force them back, there is a reſiſting in them; ſo in <hi>ſtony</hi> hearts there is much reſiſtancie, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.28, 29. <hi>All they in the Synagogue, when they heard theſe things, were filled with wrath, roſe up and thruſt him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the hill, that they might caſt him down headlong.</hi> Their flinty, rocky hearts reſiſted and rejected all the precious truths Chriſt had delivered, and made them fall fowl upon him, and ſeek to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47317:175"/> ſpill his bloud; 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.8. <hi>As Jannes and Jambres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Moſes, ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</hi> They were men of ſtony hearts reſiſting the faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart and ears, ye do alwayes reſiſt</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A <hi>ſtone</hi> is heavy, <hi>Prov:</hi> 27.3. and its motion is downwards, its earth hardned, and its whole tendency is to the earth; ſo a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is heavy, earthy, and tends down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards altogether, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 20.16. <hi>Their heart went after their idols; Ezek:</hi> 33.31. <hi>Their heart goeth after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> &amp; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.8. <hi>They ſet their heart on their iniquitie.</hi> Men are born with the ſtone in their hearts, and naturally they mind earthly things, <hi>Phil:</hi> 3.19. Their motion is downward, <hi>John</hi> 3.31. <hi>He that is of the earth is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth;</hi> his thoughts, his words, his motions, are all that way. The things of Heaven are burdenſome to a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> that cannot move upwards.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Stones</hi> keep their places, and are immoveable, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Whoſo removeth stones ſhall be hurt therewith.</hi> Great ſtones, mountains, rocks, abide fixt, and its dangerous to meddle with them; ſo <hi>ſtony hearts</hi> keep their ſtonyneſſe, they are immoveable; what opinions, principles, concluſions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have taken in, though falſe and corrupt, they are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of, and obſtinate in, <hi>Judges</hi> 2.19. <hi>They ceaſed not from their own doings, nor from their ſtubborn wayes.</hi> God ſold them into the hands of enemies where they ſuffered grievous things, God raiſed them up Deliverers, who ſet them at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet <hi>they ceaſed not from their own wayes,</hi> they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable from their own opinions, corrupt principles and dangerous tenets; men are ſo ſelf-conceited, ſelf-willed, that they are like rocks, not to be ſtirred.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Stones</hi> are dry, and have no moiſture in them at all. Take a Rock there is no water in it, take any ſtone its dry, all ſtones are dry and barren; ſo ſtony hearts they have no moiſture of grace in them, they are all dry and barren, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life are not found in them. The woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> had a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> and how dry, how barren was it? not a good word came out of it towards Chriſt; <hi>John</hi> 4. Whileſt the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:47317:175"/> were without God and Chriſt in the world, they had <hi>ſtony hearts,</hi> and ſo were barren and fruitleſs, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 54.1. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> there is no melting, no mourning, no tears.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Stones</hi> are cold; 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 25.37. its ſaid, <hi>Nabals heart dyed within him, and he became as a ſtone,</hi> that is, cold and ſenceleſſe; ſo <hi>ſtony hearts</hi> are cold, there is no ſpiritual heat in them; though the word be as fire, yet it heats them not. Men of <hi>ſtony hearts</hi> are frigid in the things of God, they contend not for the truth, they reprove not wickedneſs in others, they ſtand not for the intereſt of Chriſt, they are not zealous for God, and his glory, they put not their hands to his work, they mind not the converſion of ſinners, they are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how things of that nature go. A <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is a dead heart, and as it hath no life nor motion in it, ſo no warmth in it; like the <hi>Shunammites</hi> ſon, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.34. till <hi>Eliſha</hi> came and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth himſelf upon it, there was neither life nor warmth in it; and till Gods Spirit come and ſtretch forth its virtue and power upon a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> it hath neither life nor warmth in it. Thus you ſee wherein a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> reſembles a Stone or Rock.</p>
                     <p>Queſt: <hi>What is the evill of an hard heart?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw:</hi> 1. It is ever unthankfull; mercies, kindneſſes, do not affect it, and how then can it be thankfull? Some verball thankfullneſſe may be in an hard hearted man, but in his heart, in his life, there is nothing. Poure Wine, Oyle, the Spirits and Quinteſſence of any thing upon a ſtone, its loſt, the ſtone is not at all the better for it, not affected with it; ſo a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> let the choiceſt mercies of Heaven or Earth be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, they are loſt, that heart is unthankfull: and whereas we ſhould be thankfull in every thing, 1 <hi>Theſſ:</hi> 5.18. ſuch an one is thankfull in nothing, and makes the times perillous, 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw:</hi> 2. It grows worſe and worſe, harder and harder every day, nothing ſtops it from proceeding on in its wicked wayes. The <hi>Jews</hi> were a <hi>ſtony hearted</hi> people, and what
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47317:176"/> ſaith the Lord to them? <hi>Iſa:</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Threatning judgements did not ſtop or turn them from their wickedneſs. <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaw the wonderful judgements of God, ten plagues were upon him and his Land, and yet his heart grew harder and harder. They that came to take Chriſt went backward and fell to the ground when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am he;</hi> they ſaw alſo a miracle wrought by Chriſt, in reſtoring to <hi>Malchus</hi> his ear which <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off, yet being <hi>ſtony hearted</hi> they proceeded to take Chriſt, <hi>to bind him and carry him to the High Prieſts, John</hi> 18.6.10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. It cauſeth a man to walk contrary to his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thoſe that are Chriſtians, profeſſe Chriſt and the Goſpel, they have in Baptiſme given up themſelves to him, and obliged themſelves to walk according to Goſpel Rules; now whence is it that they profeſs one thing, and practice another, that they profeſſe Chriſtianity, and walk as Heathens, or worſe then Heathens; whoredome, drunkenneſs, covetouſneſs, lying, pride, ſwearing, theft, murther, witchery, contention, ſlander, oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are they not as frequent among Chriſtians, as ever they were among Heathens? <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> exhorted them <hi>not to walk as other Gentiles, in the vanity of their minds, having the underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their heart, who being paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have given themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſſe, to work all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſſe.</hi> It was the hardneſſe of the heathen <hi>Gentiles</hi> hearts, which made them walk ſo; and when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Gentiles</hi> walk ſo, its from the hardneſs of their hearts; we are of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and notwithſtanding our Chriſtianity, we walk contrary to Chriſt and the Goſpel, which is from the ſtonyneſs of our hearts, keeping out the power, and this is a grievous evill, we profeſs Chriſt and the Goſpel verbally, and deny both really, and ſo cauſe <hi>our holy profeſſion, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be blaſphemed, Rom:</hi> 2.24. <hi>James</hi> 2.7.</p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:47317:176"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Its a ſpirituall judgement, which is worſe then all other diſeaſes, then all other judgements; a blind eye, a deaf ear, a dumb tongue, a palſie hand, a gouty leg, a leprous head, the ſtone in the kidneys or bladder, are nothing to the ſtone in the heart, no plague is like that plague; thoſe four ſore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21. are not ſo ill as the ſtone in the heart; men are ſenſible of thoſe, and tremble at them, but the ſtonyneſs of their hearts, they neither feel nor fear, by reaſon of it. Can there be a more dreadful judgement upon a man then to be given up of God to hardneſs of heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me, ſo I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own inventions.</hi> They were ſtubborn, and God puniſhed their ſtubbornneſſe with ſtonyneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. It pleaſeth it ſelf in the wayes of wickedneſſe, <hi>Prov:</hi> 10.23. <hi>It is a ſport to a fool to do miſchief;</hi> &amp; <hi>Chap:</hi> 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin; Fools,</hi> that is, <hi>wicked men, whoſe hearts are hardned,</hi> who know not the nature of ſin, who feel not the weight of ſin, they ſlight ſin, they ſport themſelves with ſin, they rejoyce to do evill, <hi>Prov:</hi> 2.14. <hi>They count it pleaſure to ryot in the day time,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.13. There is no ſin but men of ſtony hearts take delight in, ſome in one, ſome in another, and if they can or cannot commit wickedneſſe themſelves, they take pleaſure in them that can, <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw:</hi> 6. Its the ſeat of Satan, he dwels in it. A <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is the Devils Caſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is in, and works in the children of diſobedience;</hi> In their hearts he hath ſtrong holds, keeps poſſeſſion, and rules them at his pleaſure, they are his Subjects. <hi>God dwels in a broken heart,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. but the Devill in <hi>a ſtony heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw:</hi> 7. That man that hath <hi>a ſtony heart</hi> increaſeth his own woe daily, <hi>Rom:</hi> 2.5. <hi>Thou after thy hardneſſe and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath;</hi> that is, thou cauſeſt God to treaſure up more ſevere
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47317:177"/> puniſhment for thee daily; thou ſinneſt more and more daily, and God heats the furnace hotter and hotter daily.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, By inlivening the dead and ſenſeleſs heart to feel its ſtonyneſſe. When breath and life entred into the dry bones, they were ſenſible, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 37. and when God breaths upon a ſtony heart it lives, and is ſenſible. What an Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine heart was in <hi>Paul,</hi> who took pleaſure in vexing, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and murthering of the Saints; but when Chriſt breathed upon him, and put life into him, he then became ſenſible of his hard heartedneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the warmth of his Spirit, and moiſture of his grace, love and mercy, he melts the <hi>ſtony heart.</hi> Some fire will melt braſſe and iron, and ſome waters diſſolve any ſtone; ſuch is the fire of Gods Spirit, there is not any iron or brazen heart but that can melt it; ſuch is the water of life, there is not any <hi>ſtony heart</hi> but that will diſſolve it; there is an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power in the Spirit and grace of God to turn Mil-ſtones into wax, and Rocks into ſtreams; it was verified in <hi>Paul,</hi> who feeling the mighty power of Gods Spirit and grace in his heart had the milſtonyneſs and rockyneſſe thereof removed, for preſently he cryed out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and fell to weeping and praying.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Meltingneſs. A <hi>ſtony heart</hi> never melts, but an <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> is of a melting nature. <hi>Joſiahs</hi> heart was not only affected with the Law read, but melted alſo into tears, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19. <hi>His heart was tender, and he humbled himſelf before the Lord.</hi> So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.14. <hi>My heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels;</hi> how did it melt after <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him of his ſin! <hi>Pſal:</hi> 51. ſo after his numbring of the people, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 24.17. <hi>Peters</hi> heart was of this nature, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt looked upon him, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly, Luke</hi> 22.62. Such were their hearts, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 9.4. who ſighed and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all <hi>the abominations which were done in the midſt of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> An <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> melts and mourns that God is diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by others, but moſt of all that he hath been diſhonoured by him in whom it is; that man that hath an <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> ſheds moſt tears for the wrongs himſelf hath done unto God, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18, 19.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Teachableneſſe. A <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is indocible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, it repels and keeps out truths, but an <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> admits and receives truths, it is yielding and teachable. When <hi>Lydiacs</hi> hard heart was turned into fleſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto the things which were ſpoken by the Apoſtle, ſhe received them, and believed them; ſhe was a good Scholar, and conſtrained her Teachers to come and abide at her houſe, that ſhe might learn more of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Paul</hi> no ſooner had his <hi>heart of ſtone</hi> made <hi>fleſh,</hi> but he manifeſted a teachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:47317:179"/> in himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? I am a blind Phariſee, and have been all my dayes out of the way; I deſire now to learn, and to be taught of thee whom I ignorantly blaſphemed. David</hi> ſhut not his eyes againſt the light, as many hard-hearted perſons do, he prayed, <hi>That the Lord would open his eyes that he might behold wonderous things out of the Law;</hi> He was oft begging of God to teach him, <hi>O teach me the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end, Pſal.</hi> 119.18.33. He was willing to ſee, to hear, and to do, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> When the <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is removed, and <hi>an heart of fleſh</hi> put in the room of it, that is a day of power, and then the people ſo hearted are willing to hear the Lord ſpeak, to underſtand his counſels, and to reſolve their wills into Gods, ſo that his will is theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Cor carneum quod ante ad alterius arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fingitur.</note>Fifthly, Obedientialneſſe. A <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is refractory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, diſobedient, but a fleſhy heart is yielding and obediential, it is <hi>Cor ſequari, an heart which follows God,</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> followed <hi>Elijah,</hi> virtue went out of the mantle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to do ſo, and the virtue gone out from God into <hi>an heart of fleſh</hi> prevails with it, and cauſeth it to follow God, to yield obedience unto him. <hi>Caleb</hi> had another ſpirit then the reſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> had, and he <hi>followed the Lord fully, Numb:</hi> 14.24. His ſpirit was not obſtinate but obediential, and where-ever this <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> is, it is ſo far from being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious againſt the truth, or with-holding the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as that it <hi>obeys the truth heartily, Rom:</hi> 6.17.</p>

                     <head>The Excellency of a tender heart.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, Its the Manſion of Gods holy Spirit. When the heart is tender and fleſhy, God puts in his holy Spirit into it, as in the next verſe appears. The Spirit it ſelf is a tender thing, and takes no content in an <hi>hard heart, Iſa:</hi> 57.15. <hi>Its in the heart of humble and contrite ones that the Spirit dwells.</hi> The <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were <hi>babes in Chriſt,</hi> very tender, and they <hi>were Temples of the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.16. How excellent is a tender heart
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47317:179"/> that the <hi>Spirit of Grace, Heb:</hi> 10.29. <hi>the Spirit of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 4.14. ſhould take it up for its habitation? It was there before as an Agent, not as an Inhabitant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It cannot endure the diſhonour of God; its much affected, yea afflicted thereat. When <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and reviled the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> afflicted at it? <hi>He rent his cloaths, covered himſelf with ſackcloath, and went into the houſe of the Lord, ſends for Iſaiah, begs his prayers, ſpreads the blaſphemers Letter he had received before the Lord, and cryed unto him for help to vindicate his own name,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had a <hi>tender heart,</hi> and herein was the excellency of it, he was deeply affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the diſhonour of God. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was touched throughly when men violated the Law of God, and diſhonoured his name, Pſal. 119.136. <hi>Rivers of water run down mine eyes becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> None of his own afflictions, his perſecution by <hi>Saul,</hi> his expulſion by <hi>Abſolom,</hi> did draw ſo many tears from him as the diſhonour of Gods name, that made his <hi>tender heart</hi> like a Fountain which ſends forth Rivers; the heathens who had <hi>hard hearts</hi> ſaid of their heatheniſh King, <hi>Its not meet for us to ſee the Kings diſhonour, Ezra</hi> 4.14. And can Chriſtians ſee the diſhonour of the God of Heaven? Thoſe that have <hi>hearts of fleſh</hi> cannot endure to ſee it, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help the ſame, they will mourn, and mourn abundantly for it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Its a ſtrong defence againſt all ſin; it quickly feels the nature of ſin, and ſo flyes from it. Touch tender fleſh with a Needle or Pin, it endures not the ſame, it cryes out againſt, and removes them. Some bodyes are ſo delicate that they feel every wind, every little diſtemper, and ſo fortifie themſelves againſt them; and ſome hearts are ſo tender that corruption or the Devil cannot ſtir but they diſcern, feel, and find them, and ſo ſet themſelves againſt them. When <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtriſs tempted him to folly, his heart ſtartled at it, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his tongue to ſay, <hi>How can I do this, and ſin againſt God? Gen:</hi> 39.9. A tender heart ſticks at the appearance of evill,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47317:180"/> and will not venture there: <hi>Abraham</hi> would not take any thing of the ſpoyl recovered, but returned all into the hands of the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> leaſt he ſhould ſay, <hi>I have made Abraham rich, Gen:</hi> 14.23. This was an excellent frame of ſpirit; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the tenderneſs of his heart, ſuch tenderneſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes a man againſt the poyſon of ſin. <hi>Jobs</hi> heart was fleſh, not ſtone, and not his Friends, Wife or Devil could draw him to commit ſin; his heart was ſenſible of his ſons ſinning, and on their behalf he offered ſacrifice continually, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. and that tenderneſs preſerved him from ſinning. <hi>Davids heart ſmote him when he cut off but the lap of Sauls garment,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 24.5.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Its active for God. When <hi>Pauls</hi> heart was turned into fleſh, preſently ſaith he, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do? I am now ready to do ought for thee, Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>And ſtraight way he preached Chriſt in the Synagogues, verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was of a tender heart, and he acted notably for God, he deſtroyed the groves, altars, high-places, images out of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and other places, he repaired the Temple, he cauſed the Law to be read, the people to enter into Covenant with God, he kept a moſt ſolemn Paſſeover, ſuch as had not been from <hi>Samuels</hi> dayes before, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 34. &amp; 35. <hi>Chap:</hi> A hard heart is active againſt God, and a ſoft heart is active for God. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> through the hardneſs of his heart, did more wickedly then any, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 33. And <hi>David</hi> through the tenderneſſe of his heart, fulfilled all the wills of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.22. He durſt not neglect any duty the Lord call'd for, nor do it remiſly when he went about it.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="textual_commentary">
                     <head>What are the miſtakes about a tender heart?</head>
                     <p>Firſt, There is a legal tenderneſſe which ariſes from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods Soveraignty and Juſtice, and his wrath due unto men for ſin, and their ſinfull practices, whereupon they humble themſelves, mourn, ſigh, weep, pray, and ſo manifeſt ſome tenderneſs of heart; ſuch I conceive was the tenderneſs of <hi>Manaſſeh's</hi> heart, when he was among thorns, bound in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in affliction, then he beſought the Lord, humbled
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47317:180"/> himſelf greatly, and prayed, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 33.11, 12, 13. Such tenderneſſe had <hi>Judas</hi> who repented of what he had done, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>He had ſinned in betraying innocent bloud, Mat:</hi> 27.3, 4. Terrours of conſcience put him upon it: This legal tenderneſs is not that here meant. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Apprehenſions of Gods power, juſtice, wrath, fear of death and hell, do never melt the heart. The Law, judgements of God, conſiderations of death and hell may break the <hi>ſtony heart</hi> into many pieces, yet every piece remain a ſtone, retain its hardnes: when you break a Milſtone or Rock into pieces with an hammer or pick-axe, though broken, yet there is no true ſoftneſs in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Legal tenderneſſe never loves God, it loves it ſelf, and ſeeks it ſelf; but Evangelical or Spiritual tenderneſs carries out the heart to God and Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> having hardned his heart by denyal of the Lord Jeſus once, twice, and thrice, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoftned again by a look of Chriſt upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61, 62. he loved him dearly, and that it might be known, Chriſt asked him the queſtion, <hi>Simon, loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>Peter doſt thou love me?</hi> but <hi>doſt thou love me more than theſe? I know theſe love me much, how ſtands thy heart to me?</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>Yea, I love thee, and more than theſe do love thee, and thou knoweſt it.</hi> A tender heart is ſtrongly in love with Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> after his heart was regenerate and ſoftned, he was ſo in love with Chriſt, that he wiſheth <hi>Anathema Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha</hi> to that man which loves not the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15.22.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is a naturall fleſhlineſs or tenderneſs which is much in women, and ſometimes alſo in men; as when <hi>Joſeph</hi> made himſelf known unto his brethren, he wept, it was from a natural tenderneſs in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.1, 2. Some are by nature very tender and pittyfull; ſuch tenderneſs is not what our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet aims at. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This natural tenderneſs is born with men, they bring it with them into the world; the other is a gift, <hi>I will give you an heart of fleſh;</hi> the one is of nature, the other of grace; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47317:181"/> procreate the one, God creates the other; the one is from conſtitution, the other from regeneration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where there is a natural tenderneſs it is flexible both wayes, to good and evill. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> who was a wicked King, having a tender heart, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 13.7. he was for evill and for good, he hearkned to the young mens ill counſel at one time, and to <hi>Shemaiah's</hi> good counſel another time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.14, 24. he was eaſily drawn this way and that way, like ſome in the Apoſtles time who <hi>were carryed about with every wind of Doctrine, Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. They were children, they had a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenderneſſe in them, and bowed to ſound and corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but a man that hath the tenderneſs of heart here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is untractable towards evill, and only flexible unto good, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>He cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God,</hi> his heart is obſtinate againſt ſin, he keeps himſelf from the touching of the wicked one, <hi>Chap:</hi> 5.18. <hi>But is plyable to the will of the holy one, prepared unto every good work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.21.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Natural tenderneſs is faint in the cauſe of God, it hath no courage, no magnanimity for God, but ſpiritual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs hath. <hi>Paul</hi> was tender hearted after his converſion, and ſee what a ſpirit he had for God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.22, 23. <hi>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too ſuperſtitious,</hi> &amp;c. He conteſted with the whole Univerſity of <hi>Athens.</hi> The Bock of Martyrs tells of <hi>Alice Driver</hi> (a tender hearted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) who ſaid, <hi>She would ſet her foot againſt the foot of any of them all;</hi> ſhe meant the Biſhops and their creatures; ſhe had courage for God and his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Natural tenderneſſe is dulled by faſting, prayer, and humiliation, but ſpiritual tenderneſs is ſharpned and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame. <hi>Eſther</hi> after her faſting, praying, and humbling her ſoule was more ſenſible of the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the great danger they were in, and ventured her life for them, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4. &amp; 5. <hi>Chap.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Afflictions, croſſes, are very heavy to that heart that is naturally tender, its reſtleſſe, unquiet under them, but an
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47317:181"/> heart ſpiritually tender welcomes afflictions, <hi>receives them with joy, Heb.</hi> 10.34. and finds ſin heavier then afflictions. There be ſome ſoft natures which can weep, ſhed tears in abundance for loſſe of Relations, Eſtates, Favours of great Ones, yet never wept for ſin; theſe have a natural tenderneſs, not a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     <p>Beſides what may be gathered from what is ſaid, I ſhall give ſome Characters of a <hi>tender heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Its ſenſible of the Churches and Saints afflictions, it mourns for, and with them; a <hi>tender heart</hi> bleeds when it goes ill with <hi>Sion</hi> and the people of God. When the men of <hi>Ai</hi> ſmote but thirty ſix <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> how was <hi>Joſhua</hi> affected with it? <hi>He rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face, before the Ark of the Lord, untill the even tide, Joſh.</hi> 7.6. You may read <hi>Pſ.</hi> 79. &amp; 80. how greatly <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph</hi> were affected with the deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and miſeries befell the Church. Theſe were men of <hi>tender hearts,</hi> and ſenſible of evils at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Such was <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 14.29. and <hi>Jeremy, whoſe eyes ran down with tears, becauſe the Lords flock was carryed away captive, Jer:</hi> 13.17.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Where an heart hath a gracious and ſpiritual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, its affected with the periſhing condition of others, it grieves to ſee men impenitent, unbelieving, going on in the broad way, to be in a ſtate of irregeneracy, and pityes them, <hi>Rom:</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>Paul</hi> had great heavineſs, and continual ſorrow in his heart, and why? for his <hi>brethren and kinſmen according to the fleſh; they rejected Chriſt and his Goſpel through unbelief and hardneſſe of heart,</hi> they were in the broad way to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Chriſt ſeeing <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> inſenſible of her own good, <hi>he wept over her, Luke</hi> 19.41. And in former times <hi>Jeremy</hi> had manifeſted the tenderneſs of his heart toward the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he ſaid unto them thus, <hi>Hear ye, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ve ear, be not proud; for the Lord hath ſpoken: Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cauſe darkneſſe, and before your feet ſtumble upon the dark moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the ſhadow of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47317:182"/> death, and make it groſſe darkneſſe: but if ye will not hear it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride, Jer:</hi> 13.15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A <hi>tender heart</hi> dare not go out from God in any caſe, but commits it ſelf and way to him, it conſults with God, and leans upon him for counſel and direction. <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when the Law was found, and he underſtood from it what wrath was due to the breach of it, preſently ſends men to enquire of the Lord for himſelf and others what to do; he took counſel of God, and not of man, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 34.21. So <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> he ſought not to <hi>Baalim,</hi> but to the Lord God of his fathers; and <hi>David made Gods Teſtimonyes his Counſellers,</hi> Pſal. 119.24. Hard hearts dare preſume and venture to go out from God, and into wayes he hath not warranted; ſo did <hi>Gehazi, Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> they followed the imaginations of their own hearts, and declared that their hearts were Braſſe. Thoſe that have hearts of fleſh ſay with them in <hi>Iſa:</hi> 2.3. <hi>Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> not in our own.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Its affected preſently at the frowns and chidings of God, at the appearance and ſhaking of the Rod. A child of a tender nature will melt when the Parent begins to manifeſt diſpleaſure, as to chide or take the Rod into his hand; but its not ſo with a ſtubborn nature, that will hear bitter words, and endure many ſtroaks before it will melt, <hi>Jer:</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou hast ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refuſed to return:</hi> Theſe had no tender hearts in them. When <hi>Abſolom</hi> had driven <hi>David</hi> out of <hi>Jeruſalem, he went up mount Olivet weeping:</hi> He was preſently affected with the hand of God, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 15.30. <hi>Moſes</hi> was preſently affected with the wrath that went out from God againſt the people, <hi>Numb:</hi> 16.46.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A <hi>tender heart</hi> feels much ſtonineſſe in it ſelf, and complains of it; <hi>O what a ſtony, rocky, Adamantine heart have I!</hi> ſaith a tender hearted man: its tenderneſſe diſcovers and feels hardneſſe, <hi>Eph:</hi> 4.19. <hi>They were hardned in ſin, were paſt
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47317:182"/> feeling,</hi> Where hearts are all <hi>ſtone,</hi> there is no ſenſibleneſs of the ſtonyneſs; thoſe have the tendereſt hearts, that feel moſt Braſs and Iron in them. <hi>David</hi> cryed oft to God for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 119.154, 156, 159. <hi>Quicken me according to thy Word; Quicken me according to thy judgements; Quicken me according to thy loving kindneſſe.</hi> And why did he cry ſo for quickning? becauſe he felt much deadneſs and hardneſs in his heart. A dead heart is an hard heart: A man when dead is cold, ſtiff, and hard; ſo a mans heart, if dead within him, is cold, ſtiff, and ſtony.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="textual_commentary">
                     <head>How may the heart be kept tender?</head>
                     <p>Firſt, By taking heed of every ſin, for its only ſin that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the heart; as the foot by treading hardens the earth, ſo when ſin walks up and down in the heart it hardens and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſame; <hi>Dan:</hi> 5.20. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars mind was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in pride;</hi> and the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>Heb:</hi> 3.13. <hi>That mens hearts come to be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin.</hi> Men think little ſins can do them little harm; but they harden their hearts, and is that no harm? is that little harm? its the greateſt harm can be done you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By ſearching and examining of your hearts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that is a ſpecial means to keep them tender; its like digging of the Garden, and ploughing of the Earth, which keeps it from hardning; the more digging and ploughing, the more tender and crumbly is the earth, that is the chiefeſt way to preſerve it ſo; and they who are ever ſearching their hearts, examining them daily, have them in a tender frame. <hi>David communed oft with his own heart, and his ſpirit made diligent ſearch, Pſal.</hi> 77.6. That kept his heart in a tender frame.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By ſtudying the word much and minding it there is great virtue in the word, it's like fire, and will not only thaw the icyneſs of their hearts, but keep them unfrozen; the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mettals while they are in the Fire are ſoft, and whileſt mens hearts are in the Divine fire of the Scriptures, they will be ſoft. The Word is like Water and Oyl which moiſten and

                     <p>Fourthly, By meditating ſeriouſly on Gods love, the heigths, depths, lengths, and breadths of his love. When a ſoul is taken up with thoughts of the freeneſs, greatneſs, ſtrength, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, everlaſtingneſs, and fruits of Gods love, it will be in a melting frame, that fire works kindly upon the heart; love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended makes the heart tender.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Look much to Chriſt crucified, <hi>Zech:</hi> 12.10. When we conſider what Chriſt hath ſuffered for our ſakes, it will make and keep our hearts tender.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A tender heart is a choice mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a <hi>ſtony heart</hi> is a grievous plague, ſo an <hi>heart of fleſh</hi> is a great bleſſing, its ſenſible of ſin, even ſecret ſins, it trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at thoughts of God, his Attributes and Word, it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands divine things, its teachable and obediential, its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate and full of bowels towards all; ſuch an heart is rare to find, but where-ever it is, it's a mercy of mercies, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Its a gift, even the gift of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> None but he who can fetch water out of a Rock, and turn ſtones into fleſh, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.) can give this tender heart; we can make our hearts ſtony by ſinning, but we cannot ſoften them again. Its Gods preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to make and give an <hi>heart of fleſh;</hi> he can make the hardeſt heart exceeding tender: beg ſuch an heart of him, and preſſe him with his promiſe; <hi>For faithfull is he who hath promiſed, who alſo will do it.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>ſpirit</hi> by reaſon of its Infiniteneſſe, is every where, in Trees, Worms, Flowers, waters, all creatures; is it any other wiſe in the Saints then in them? True, the ſpirit <hi>quoad eſſentiam</hi> is in all things; yet,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Its not in them <hi>per modum unionis,</hi> by way of union; a Fiſh is in the water, but not united to the water; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is in the Saints by way of union, therefore is ſaid to <hi>dwell in them</hi> by his own gifts and graces; we are united to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> to us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Its not in them <hi>per modum gratioſae operationis,</hi> by way of gracious operation; all he doth in other creatures, is upholding their beings, enabling them to put forth their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power, vigour, virtue, and ordering their motions to what ends he pleaſeth, he worketh nothing in them above their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but in thoſe <hi>he dwells,</hi> he worketh gracious effects, in thoſe the Lord gives the <hi>ſpirit</hi> unto, he worketh ſuch operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are not elſewhere, even ſuch as are aboue nature; he is in them <hi>Speciali titulo ratione gratiae:</hi> A Gardiner worketh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Knots in the Garden, which he doth not elſewhere; God made other works, and ſet other plants in Paradiſe than in the world.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, As the Deity of Chriſt is every where in every creature, yet otherwiſe in Chriſts humane nature, than in any creature, <hi>Col:</hi> 2.9. ſo the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> though it be every where, yet is otherwiſe in Believers, than in other creatures, it is in them as it is in Chriſt himſelf, but not in the ſame meaſure.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="textual_commentary">
                     <head>What doth the ſpirit being within us?</head>
                     <p>Firſt, It unites the Lord Chriſt and the ſoul together, it makes an happy union between them two. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were eſpouſed to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. not only by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Paul,</hi> but by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one ſpirit are we all baptized into one body;</hi> that is, the Church, the body of Chriſt; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the great Agent in this work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> gives out divine Oracles and Truths unto the ſoul: As in the Temple God gave out his mind, made known his will, ſo doth the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the heart of man; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The ſpirit of the Father ſpeaks in Believers;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ye have an anction from the holy One, and ye know all things.</hi> That unction is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which makes known all needful things unto thoſe it dwells in; its needful to be inſtructed, and armed againſt Antichriſt and his ſeducements, its needful to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the way to Heaven, they had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which did teach them how to avoid the one, and how to proceed in the other; and ſo were <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, taught of God; <hi>and who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth like him? Job</hi> 36.22. He teacheth inwardly, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, powerfully.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It conquers and drives out the enemies that had poſſeſſion of, and quartered in us. There is no man the Lord puts his <hi>ſpirit</hi> into, but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> finds the Devil there, he hath poſſeſſion of mens hearts, and labours to keep the ſame; there be alſo a multitude of baſe and ungodly luſts which fight for the Devils intereſt, theſe the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſets upon, ſubdues and caſts out. When <hi>Chriſt came into the Temple, he whipt out all the money-changers;</hi> when <hi>Joſhua came into Canaan, he drove out the Canaanites and other Nations;</hi> and when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> comes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47317:185"/> into a man it beats down ſtrong holds, drives out Satan and his Troops; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. <hi>Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> The Devil had been in them before, but was now driven out of them into the world by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which was in them, and their luſts were mortified by the ſame <hi>ſpirit, Rom:</hi> 8.13.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Spirit</hi> put into man, takes the rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that man into his own hand; he muſt no longer be under the dominion of ſin or Satan, but under the conduct of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he, and all in him, muſt bow to that great Perſon. When a great man cometh into the Countrey to dwell, he looks for all about him to bow unto him, and to be at his command; hence men that have ſtout and ſtubborn ſpirits which cannot bow uſe to ſay, <hi>Magnum vicinum nolumus, We care not for a great Neighbour.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is greater than all men, and when he is put into men, it's to rule; he is there not to be checked, controled, oppoſed, but to bear ſway, to have the Keyes of every Room delivered up unto him, he muſt be, and will be Soveraign in the ſoul, <hi>before him every Mountain and Hill muſt be brought low, yea every creature muſt ſwear fealty unto him,</hi> Rom: 8.14. <hi>They are lead by the ſpirit of God.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the Commander and Leader of thoſe it dwells in, they follow him and not others; whereas thoſe that are without the <hi>ſpirit are led away with diverſe luſts,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.6. or <hi>drawn away with their own luſt, James</hi> 1.14. <hi>and ſo follow Satan,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5.15. It's not ſo with thoſe that have the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that is call'd <hi>A Guide, John</hi> 16.13. and ſuch <hi>a Guide, as guides into all truth,</hi> and orders them ſo, as that they ſhall not miſcarry, <hi>for its a ſpirit of wiſdome, Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. <hi>of counſell, Iſa:</hi> 11.2. <hi>of power,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.7. ſo that he muſt rule, and where he rules, he doth it wiſely.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He frames them to his own mind, and transforms them into his own likeneſſe: as a Graft put into a Stock, turns the ſap of the Stock, and aſſimilates it and the Stock to it ſelf; ſo doth the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the parties where it is, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3.18. <hi>We are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory, even as by the
<pb facs="tcp:47317:185"/>
                           <pb facs="tcp:47317:186"/>
                           <pb n="353" facs="tcp:47317:186"/> Spirit of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>by the Lord the Spirit,</hi> ſo the Greek will bear it; we are ſelfiſh, ſinfull, natural, morall, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> makes us ſpiritual. The husband frames the mind of his wiſe ſuitable unto his own; when a man comes into an old houſe, he pulls down, and ſets up, he takes away and adds what he pleaſes, and fits the houſe to his own mind; ſo doth the <hi>ſpirit</hi> being in our earthly Tabernacles, it abrogates the Laws of the fleſh, it throws out the Principles of Satan, and the world, it ſets up new Laws, and works new Principles, <hi>Rom:</hi> 3.27. Chap: 8.2.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> being put into man, and man becoming his Temple, he doth beautifie and adorn that Temple, and make it glorious. <hi>Solomon over-laid the Temple with pure gold,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.21. the inſide was very glorious; and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> trims up its Temple with pure graces, with <hi>love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal:</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.9. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> garniſhed the Heavens with thoſe greater and leſſer Lights, <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. which fill this lower world with their glory: Its the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which reneweth the face of the earth, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 104.30. and makes it beautifull, and its the <hi>ſpirit</hi> reneweth and garniſheth the ſoul, making it glorious and beautifull with all graces, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within;</hi> and the <hi>ſpirits</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is no leſſe glorious: If <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple were call'd <hi>The holy and beautifull houſe, Iſa.</hi> 64.11. much more may the Temple of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, It being in man enables him to do many things, it ſtrengthens him with might to do that which otherwiſe he could not do, <hi>Eph:</hi> 3.16. As</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To diſcern between the things of men, and the things of God, between the things of Chriſt, and thoſe of Antichriſt, between true and counterfeit graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>He that is ſpiritual judgeth all things.</hi> He hath the <hi>ſpirit</hi> enabling him to make a difference, and to ſee the reallity, beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſome things above others: The High Prieſts, Scribes &amp; Phariſees, ſaw no beauty in Chriſt that they ſhould deſire him,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47317:187"/> but the Apoſtles who had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in them did, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw ſo much in Chriſt, and the knowledge of him, <hi>That he counted all things but laſſe for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It enables them to pray ſpiritually, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit</hi> tells us what to pray for, and helps us to bring forth thoſe Petitions it hath formed in us; <hi>Zech:</hi> 12.10. its call'd <hi>The ſpirit of ſupplication,</hi> becauſe it teaches us what to ſupplicate God for, and aſſiſts us in ſupplicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts thoſe they write unto, <hi>To pray in the ſpirit, Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Jude</hi> 20. That is, in the ſtrength and help of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> not in their own ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It enables to ſtand in time of trouble, perſecution and ſufferings: The <hi>ſpirit</hi> prompts anſwers unto thoſe that are queſtioned for truths ſake, and helps them againſt all their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, ſee <hi>Mark</hi> 13.11. <hi>Matth:</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.11, 12. When they were lead before Magiſtrates and Powers, they muſt take no thought before hand what to ſpeak, nor premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhould help them, encourage, and uphold them, not an Angel, but the <hi>ſpirit; Acts</hi> 6.10. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſo mightily aſſiſted by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> that his oppoſers, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,</hi> and others were not able to withſtand him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It enables to bring forth good fruit. If there be no ſap in a Vine, it will bear no fruit; if there be only our own ſap, it will yeeld ſowre fruit; but if the ſap of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> be there, then it will afford good fruit, ſpeciall fruit, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>Chriſt being anointed with the holy ſpirit, and with power, he went about doing good;</hi> ſo the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. <hi>Ye ſhall receive power after the holy ſpirit is come upon you, and ye ſhall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and unto the uttermoſt parts of the earth.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered them to walk up and down in the world, to preach the Goſpel, convert ſouls, plant Churches, and to do them good; ſo did <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15.19. Where the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is, it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and provokes unto good, <hi>John</hi> 7.38, 39.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:47317:187"/>

                     <p>Fifthly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> enables men to keep the Word of God, and yeeld obedience unto it; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the holy ſpirit which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us. Timothy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, thou haſt that which is of great concernment committed to thy keeping,</hi> viz: <hi>the Goſpel, the form of ſound words, and thou haſt a great helper to enable thee thereunto, even the ſpirit of God which dwells in thee; ſee therefore that thou keep it by the enabling power of the ſpirit, which helps not only to remember truth, but alſo to obey truth;</hi> for <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That the beleeving Jews did obey the truth through the ſpirit;</hi> that is, through the aſſiſtance of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> This is that which follows in the next words to be opened.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, The making of Godlineſſe and Religion our chief work in this life: other things are to be done as inferiour things, this is to be the principal, no work ſhould be ſo minded as this; ſaith <hi>Joſhua Chap.</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord; that ſhall be our great and chief buſineſſe in this world:</hi> He remembred what God had commended to him and all men, Deut. 6.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up; and thou ſhalt bind them for a ſign upon thine hand, and they ſhall be as frontlets
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47317:189"/> between thine eyes, and thou ſhalt write them upon the poſts of thine houſe, and upon thy gates.</hi> God would have us to be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inwardly and outwardly, at home and abroad, night and day, and to make our familyes religious; and they are repeated again, <hi>Deut:</hi> 11.18, 19, 20. that ſo they might take the deeper impreſſion upon the hearts of men. <hi>David</hi> looked at this work above all others, Pſal. 119.97. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day.</hi> To be godly and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious was his principal care, that is the one thing neceſſary; and <hi>Solomon</hi> hath drawn it up into this concluſion, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandements, for this is the whole duty of man, Eccleſ:</hi> 12.13.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Taking delight in the wayes of God: His ſtatutes, commands, and wayes are grievous to men, naturally they walk not in them: When men walk in any way, they are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with and in that way; ſo here, <hi>walking in Gods ſtatutes</hi> notes delight, Pſal: 119.14. <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as much as in all riches.</hi> Some rejoyce in fine houſes, ſome in fertile Lands, ſome in great Flocks, ſome in Silver and Gold, but <hi>David</hi> rejoyced in the <hi>way of Gods Teſtimonies, and as much as any of them, or all of them in their riches;</hi> he found more ſweet in them, then they in their wealth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 143. <hi>Thy Commandements are my delights:</hi> They were his chief, his ſatisfying, his ſole and ſoul delights. It was meat and drink to <hi>Paul,</hi> to be doing the will and work of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. as it was unto Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.34.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It imports motion and progreſſe; they ſhould not ſtand ſtill in contemplation, nor ſit ſtill in meditation, but they ſhould proceed and go on in the wayes of God, they ſhould get neerer their journeys end, be daily more knowing, more holy, more gracious and godly. The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> faith did <hi>grow exceedingly, and their charity abounded,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>They walked from faith to faith, and from love to love.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, and brought into the way of Chriſt, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in ſpiritual ſtrength, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.22. <hi>He reached forward, and preſſed towards the mark, Phil:</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>He put on migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb facs="tcp:47317:189"/>
                           <pb facs="tcp:47317:190"/>
                           <pb n="357" facs="tcp:47317:190"/> for to get the knowledge of Chriſt, and the power of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings;</hi> he did not only walk, but ran oft in the way of truth and godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Walking in Gods ſtatutes,</hi> imports perſeverance in them; they ſhall not apoſtatize and turn back from them, but continue in them. Of a wicked man deſtitute of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>He hath left off to be wiſe, and to do good,</hi> Pſal. 36.1. But of a righteous man its ſaid, <hi>He ſhall hold on in his way,</hi> Job 17.9. He knows he is in a ſafe and good way, a way that will recompence him fully at the end, whatever hardſhips or ſtorms he meets withall, and therefore will neither ſit ſtill nor go back, he may be <hi>extra ſemitam</hi> ſometimes, but never turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again.</p>

                        <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgements</hi> are comprehenſive words, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are uſed promiſcuouſly, as hath formerly been ſhewed in <hi>Chap:</hi> 18. and 5. but here they may be thus differenced, <hi>Statutes</hi> to ſignifie the duties of the firſt Table, the things of Gods worſhip and manner of the ſame, whether under the Law or Goſpel; and <hi>Judgements,</hi> the duties of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, matters of equity and juſtice between man and man.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gods ſpirit differs from all other ſpirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Angels are ſpirits, ſouls of men are ſpirits, but theſe are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Gods <hi>ſpirit; I will put my ſpirit.</hi> Gods <hi>ſpirit is a ſpirit of holineſſe, Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>The power of the higheſt, Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>A ſpirit of truth guiding into all truth, John</hi> 16.13. <hi>A ſpirit of grace, Zech:</hi> 12.10. <hi>The Oyl of gladneſſe, Heb:</hi> 1.9. <hi>The

                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The putting in of the ſpirit into the ſons of men, is a free act of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doth it not upon the account of the Covenant of works, but by vertue of the Covenant of grace. This <hi>verſe</hi> is a branch of the Covenant of grace, and agrees with that in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> that God doth when he puts in his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> being within, writes divine truths in the heart: <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law writ in his heart by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but not as it is written by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the hearts of Believer, who are under the new Covenant; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> writ the Law in <hi>Adams</hi> heart as Concreator with the Father and the Son, not by vertue of any Covenant; but Believers receive the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and have the Law writ in them by vertue of Covenant; God hath covenanted to put his <hi>ſpirit</hi> in them, and they have the <hi>ſpirit</hi> from Chriſt and the Father; Chriſt purchaſed of the Father the miſſion of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> therefore ſaith, <hi>He will ſend the Comforter unto them, John</hi> 16.7. <hi>And that he will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend the Comforter unto them, John</hi> 14.16. So that Believers now have the <hi>ſpirit</hi> from God as a Father in Chriſt, from Chriſt as Head of the Church, and both theſe by vertue of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; <hi>Adam</hi> had not the <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſo: and for thoſe that had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> under the Law (for ſome had it as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. <hi>Nehem:</hi> 9.20. <hi>Numb:</hi> 27.18. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.5.) they had it not by vertue of the Covenant of works, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> for none were able to keep the Law, but by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb facs="tcp:47317:191"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:47317:192"/>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:47317:192"/> of grace; there was Goſpel in the Law, yea, the whole Ceremonial Law was ſo: The Apoſtle tells us that the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans received not the ſpirit by the works of the Law, but by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3.2. And look how the <hi>Gentiles</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham, viz. the ſpirit, which was through faith, and through Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 14. ſo did the <hi>Jews</hi> likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>Neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles</hi> do bring any preparations or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications towards the reception of the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> God gives his <hi>ſpirit</hi> freely where there are no ſuch things: when men are in a ſtate of ſin and wickedneſſe, the <hi>ſpirit is put in;</hi> firſt, its there, and then it works grace; before they have new hearts, new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the ſtone be taken out of the heart, and there be an <hi>heart of fleſh;</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is put in and acts, he finds not qualifications or diſpoſitions, but brings them, works them. The Bees when they come to the Hive, find no wax, no honey there, but they bring the wax and honey; ſo the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> when it comes to mens hearts it finds no wax, no honey, no graces, nor graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſitions there, but brings them; when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> comes to regenerate and ſanctifie it finds nothing in men but darkneſs, unbelief, unholineſſe, and enmity, by which its no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed than an Angel by coming into the world which lyes in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, or the Sun ſhining upon a Dunghil; but when it comes to be an Inhabitant, a Comforter, a ſpirit of glory to reſt upon a man, then it finds the heart prepared, and made meet for its entertainment and abode.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The gift of the ſpirit is a great and excellent gift.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will put,</hi> or <hi>give my ſpirit within you.</hi> The greatneſs and excellency of it appears in theſe following particulars:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Its the perſon of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which is a fundamental mercy, and more conſiderable than all his gifts and graces which flow from him; the Tree is better than all the fruit, the Sun is of more worth than all his Beams.</p>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:47317:193"/>
                     <p>Secondly, It is the procreator of all grace in the ſoul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is love, joy, peace, faith:</hi> Take but thoſe four graces, &amp; ſee how they are exalted; <hi>faith</hi> is ſtiled <hi>precious,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>peace</hi> is ſaid to <hi>paſſe all underſtanding, Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>joy to be glorious and unſpeakable,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. and <hi>love</hi> is magnified by <hi>Paul</hi> above all gifts and other graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. What a gift then is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which is the Parent, not only of theſe, but of all graces and all gifts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit it in all goodneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is the Conſervator of all grace and good things in us: As God conſerves the world which is his creature, ſo the <hi>ſpirit</hi> conſerves grace which is its creature; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> as it gives being to all graces, ſo it preſerves them in their beings and operations; <hi>It's the ſpirit which mortifies luſts, Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>And it is the ſpirit maintains graces, John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> As fleſh brings forth fleſh, ſo it maintains the ſame, and as <hi>the ſpirit</hi> brings forth <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſo it maintains the ſame; each maintains their own off-ſprings. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the Nurſe of all thoſe graces it hath brought forth in the heart of any; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. its called <hi>The ſpirit of faith,</hi> not only becauſe it creates faith in the heart, but keeps it there; ſo its called <hi>The ſpirit of grace, Zech.</hi> 12.10. not only becauſe it works grace in men, but alſo becauſe it keeps grace in them; hence <hi>thoſe who are after the ſpirit,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>mind the things of the ſpirit;</hi> their graces are maintained by the proviſion of the <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is he who actuates and conſummates our graces; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> doth not content it ſelf to beget and preſerve graces in mens hearts, but improves and perfects them; we and our graces would act very poorly, did not the <hi>ſpirit</hi> aſſiſt us, <hi>John:</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can do nothing;</hi> that is, without my <hi>ſpirit</hi> concurre with your graces and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate them, <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> The Mill may have all things fit for motion, the Sails may be ſpread, but if the wind blow not, the Mill goes not; ſo a man may through grace be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fitted to every good work, but if the <hi>ſpirit</hi> blow not,
<pb facs="tcp:47317:193"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:47317:194"/>
                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:47317:194"/> he moves not, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickens;</hi> it quickens us and our graces alſo; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The ſpirit gives life,</hi> Life to mens perſons, and life to their graces; its the <hi>ſpirit</hi> makes lively, and ſets grace a work. It's the Sun and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Heaven which draw up the ſap, and make the Tree grow, and it is the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and its influences, which draw out our graces into act, they lye ſtill unleſs freſh blaſts of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> come upon us and them. And as the <hi>ſpirit</hi> acts our graces, ſo it perfects them, it adds ſupplyes unto them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. and changes us into further glory, day by day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. And what is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Heb:</hi> 12.2. <hi>That he is the Authour and Finiſher of our faith;</hi> the ſame Chriſt doth by his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ſo the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the Authour and Finiſher of all our graces.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is a great and excellent gift, in that it doth facilitate, ſweeten, and make delightfull unto us all the wayes of God; they are hard and harſh to fleſh and bloud, as to deny a mans ſelf, to paſſe by wrongs, to forgive enemies, to bear the Croſſe cheerfully, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are things corrupt nature cannot digeſt; but where the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is given, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come eaſie; the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is <hi>the oyl of gladneſſe,</hi> and makes the ſoul cheerfully fall in with whatever is of God. When a child hath the father to go before, and leads it by the hand, though the way be ſtony, durty, up hill, it goes willingly; ſo the ſoul that hath the <hi>ſpirit</hi> to lead it, let the way be what it will, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth willingly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart;</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> doth enlarge the heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. where that is there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; let the Lord command things hard, <hi>David</hi> will run to do them, they are ſuitable to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the work of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the heart.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The <hi>ſpirit</hi> is an excellent gift, in that it makes them excellent who have it, <hi>Dan:</hi> 5.10, 11. ſaith the Queen to <hi>Belſhazzer, There is a man in thy Kingdome in whom is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the holy gods, he is an excellent man, none like him in all thy Provinces, he hath the ſpirit of the gods in him, which others have not.</hi> Where the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God is put into a man, that man is an excellent man, he hath an excellent perſon in him, more
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47317:195"/> excellent than his ſoul, than all ſouls, than all Angels, he hath excellent graces, and is honourable above others, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.6. <hi>There is in this City a man of God, and he is an honourable man,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervant; <hi>ſo every one that hath the ſpirit, be he in the City, or out of it, is a man of God, and an honourable man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is an union between the Saints and the ſpirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you;</hi> it is not ſaid, <hi>I will put my ſpirit upon you,</hi> but <hi>within you;</hi> So that by vertue of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it works in you, there ſhall be an union between you and my <hi>ſpirit.</hi> This union is not ſuch as is between the three <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. for they are one eſſentially, nor ſuch as is between the Deity, and Chriſts humane nature, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. for that is perſonal, but it is a myſtical union, an union of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not a perſonall union. It is</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Reall; there is a true oneneſs between the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and thoſe its put into, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> he ſaith not <hi>is one body,</hi> or <hi>one ſoul,</hi> or <hi>hath one ſpirit with the Lord,</hi> but <hi>is one ſpirit;</hi> there is as reall an union as is between ſoul and body, he is ſo one with the <hi>ſpirit</hi> as he is denominated <hi>ſpirit, John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a wonderful union. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God who is one with the Father and the Son, to be one alſo with man, and not with one man, but all he is put into, even thouſands of men, is wonderfull. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>It was a great wonder to ſee a woman cloathed with the Sun, Rev:</hi> 12.1. but it is a greater wonder to ſee a man or woman united to the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of God, which is in our ſouls and bodyes, the faculties and members of them, as the ſap is in the root, vine, and branches; and here is the wonder, the ſame ſap to be in every one of theſe, and in all other Vines.</p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:47317:195"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is a moſt glorious union. <hi>When the Lord came into the Temple it was filled with glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.11. and when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is put into a man, and the union made between them, the man is filled with glory: when the Sun ſhines into an houſe, it fills it with glory; when the fire is in the Iron, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is it? the union between the Fire and the Iron makes the Iron a thick, dark, ſolid body, as glorious as the Fire it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is a ſtrong and intimate union which cannot be diſſolved; <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you,</hi> that is, <hi>into their inward parts;</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is deeply ſeated, and ſtrongly united unto thoſe it is in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will dwell in them.</hi> The Greek is, <hi>I will indwell in them;</hi> there is ſuch an indwelling of Gods <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the hearts of his, that he will neither leave, nor be thruſt out of his habitation; <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. I am leaving you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but when I am gone, I will intercede with the Father for you, and he ſhall ſend the ſpirit, the great Comforter, and he ſhall never leave you, he ſhall abide with you for ever, none ſhall be able to diſpoſſeſſe or drive him out of you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object: <hi>But both theſe ſeem contrary to Scripture,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.14. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord departed from Saul; and David did drive away the ſpirit, when he committed his great ſins of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and adultery.</hi>
                     </p>

We muſt beware of an error here which hath ſiezed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers of late, <hi>viz: That becauſe the ſpirit is in us, and the principle of life and motion, that therefore the ſpirit doth all.

Thoſe which concerned men, as well as thoſe concern'd God, for they are all of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being from the ſame God, and branches of his infinite wiſdome; the one tending to mans good, and Gods glory, as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47317:200"/> well as the other, which <hi>David</hi> knew, and therefore kept. So <hi>Paul,</hi> his care was not only to mind the duties of holineſs towards God, but thoſe of righteouſneſs towards men, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man.</hi> Had he not kept the judgements ſet of God between man and man, his conſcience had not been innocent, but becauſe he did keep them, therefore he could ſay, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.10. <hi>To the Jews have I done no wrong; and to the Corinthian Gentiles, we have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. He had the <hi>ſpirit</hi> within him which carryed him forth ſtrongly to do juſt, righteous, and equall things, and to move others thereunto, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally Brethren, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</hi> He writ theſe words unto the <hi>Philippians</hi> as his laſt words, that ſo they might take the deeper impreſſion in them; knowing that if ſecond Table duties were not done, firſt Table duties would be in vain. See how the Lord with indignation takes up the <hi>Jews</hi> for failing in their duties towards men, though they did their duty towards him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.6, 9, 10. <hi>Will ye oppreſs the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe, and the widow? will ye ſteal, murder, and commit adultery, and ſwear falſly, and come and ſtand before me in this houſe?</hi> what, do you come hither for to pray, to hear the Law, to offer Sacrifice, and think I am pleaſed with theſe duties? no, no, <hi>I will deſtroy the Temple where ye worſhip, and I will caſt ye out of my ſight as I have done all your brethren, even the whole ſeed of Ephraim, verſ.</hi> 14, 15. It is in vain to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, if we be not righteous; ſuch Religion is a dreadful provocation of God, as you may read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Many are religious in theſe dayes, but where is a righteous man? <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs, juſt and equal things, is righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. Let us learn, as to walk in Gods Statutes, that is to be religious, ſo to keep his judgements and do them, that is to be righteous; for of the three great things
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47317:200"/> which God requires of man, this is the firſt, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, O man, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi>

It's life is here promiſed; which he mentions firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Prophet, though it were performed laſt; for the bones muſt firſt be united, then be cloathed with ſinews, fleſh and skin, before the breath of life enters.</p>

                        <hi>There is a mighty efficacy in Gods word, when he is pleaſed to concurr with it, and to be preſent with it in his own Ordinance.

When God accompanies his Word, it is a Creating-word, an Inlivening-word, yea, and a Killing-word. <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.14. <hi>It came to paſſe when I Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, that Pelatiah died.</hi> It's ſaid of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that he ſhould ſlay thoſe eſcaped the ſword of <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.7. But how ſhould that be? for he was no ſword-man: it was to be done by his Propheſying, which was ſharper then their Swords.</p>

The Father had not the ſoul or body of the Son, or the Daughter the ſoul or body of the Mother; but, every one had their own bodies and ſouls. <hi>Job</hi> was of this faith, ſaying, <hi>Though after my skin, wormes deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold,</hi> Job 19.26, 27.</p>

                        <hi>Verſe 11.</hi> Theſe bones are the whole houſe of Iſrael.</head>
                     <p>The Bones themſelves were not the <hi>houſe of Iſrael:</hi> but they ſignified and repreſented the Condition of the <hi>houſe of Iſrael,</hi> which being captive in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were like unto the dry Bones in the open Valley. To inſiſt a little upon the Reſemblance between them.</p>

                        <pb n="438" facs="tcp:47317:225"/>1. The Bones were many, very many, the Valley was full of bones; when they were quickned, they made a great Army. So were the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were very many. Thoſe came out with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> were 49897. or, Fifty thouſand wanting One hundred and three, <hi>Exra</hi> 2.64, 65. Beſides thoſe that came with <hi>Ezra</hi> afterward, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. And many there were which never returned. In thoſe 70. years they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> they multipled into a great number.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Bones were without skin, fleſh, and ſinews; the Worms, Fowls, or Wild beaſts, had eaten up them. So the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtript of Wealth, and Subſtance, the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had eaten up that. <hi>Lament</hi> 1.10. <hi>The adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary hath ſpread out his hand upon all her pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They broke their bones, they held them faſt, and wearyed them with burdens and Taxes, they flea'd off their skins, eat their fleſh, and ſuckt their bloud.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Bones were disjoynted and ſeparated from their places, one here, another there. So the <hi>Jews</hi> were rent from their Habitations and Countrey, and were ſcattered all over <hi>Babylon. Ezek.</hi> 34 6. <hi>My flock was ſcattered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the face of the earth;</hi> that is, chiefly, the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> earth. They were forced out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and diſperſed into all parts of <hi>Babylon.</hi> This made <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to ſay, <hi>Chap.</hi> 50.17. <hi>Iſrael is a ſcattered ſheep.</hi> The Princes, the Nobles, the Prieſts, the Prophets, and the People, were all ſcattered one from another; the Bones of that Common wealth, were pulled all aſunder and thrown into ſeveral places.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Bones were dry, yea, very dry; they had no moyſture or Marrow in them. Such was the <hi>houſe of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> being in the furnace of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Their long Captivity, with the evils attending it, had dryed up their moyſture and marrow. They wanted the Milk and Honey they
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:47317:225"/> had in <hi>Canaan</hi> for their bodies, and the Manna they had for their ſouls; they were without a Temple &amp; the Ordinances of it; ſo that not only their bodies, but their ſouls alſo were as dry bones, for they ſaid, <hi>They were without hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Bones being uncovered, lay expoſed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and injury of any foot that paſſed by them: And the <hi>Jews</hi> the time of their being in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were expoſed to ſcorns and injuries from all ſorts, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 36.14, 15, 30. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.3. The whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a deriſion and ſcorn to the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>

When a man is in his grave, he is cut off from the Land of the living, laid in darkneſs, bound with grave-clothes, and preſſed down with earth: So theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were cut off from their own Land, had long been in <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> darkneſs, were bound up by <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Laws and Power, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and kept down by the Tyranny of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> that they were without hope of liberty.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had a Viſion of <hi>dry bones,</hi> and who could tell the meaning of this Viſion? Many have miſtaken about it; but God himſelf he told the Prophet, and ſo all others, what was the ſenſe of that Viſion, <hi>Behold, the bones are the whole houſe of Iſrael.</hi> God who is the authour of Viſions, Types and Parables, knoweth beſt what is the meaning of them. He knew what <hi>the golden Candleſtick,</hi> and <hi>the two Olive trees on the right and left ſides thereof</hi> meant, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted them unto <hi>Zechariah,</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſion of <hi>four Beaſts,</hi> Chap. 7. did the Lord open and make known unto him. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion of <hi>the woman ſitting upon a ſcarlet coloured Beaſt full of names of blaſphemie, having ſeven heads and ten horns;</hi> the Lord interpreted and made known unto him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.

                     <p>

                        <hi>Theſe bones are the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> they were not the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a literal ſenſe, but they ſignified the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It's frequent, in the Word, to give the name of the thing ſignified, to the thing ſignifying, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>That Rock was Chriſt;</hi> here the Rock is call'd Chriſt; whereas, the Rock did only ſignifie Chriſt.

Such was <hi>Joſephs</hi> condition, when his Brethren caſt him into a pit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.24. Such was the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> condition at the Red-ſea, when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were behind them, the Sea before them, and no door of hope left unto them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. their hope was gone, and nothing but death preſented it ſelf unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. when the Anchor of hope is broken, men are in a Sea of troubles, toſſed up and down, ready to ſink every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf was ſomtime in this caſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.6. <hi>My dayes are ſwifter then a Weavers ſhuttle, and are ſpent without hope:</hi> he had neither hope of reſtauration to his former condition, nor of continuance of his life; he looked only to make <hi>the grave his houſe, and darkneſs his bed,</hi> Chap. 17.13, 14 15. His hope was gone, and he thought he muſt go to <hi>corruption, and the worms.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>When men are in great Afflictions, they manifeſt great weakneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> being in ſuch an afflicted condition, they forgot what Promiſes God had made to them of <hi>Returning after</hi> 70 <hi>years,</hi> Jer. 25.12, 13. Chap. 29.10. They minded not Gods Power, or Faithfulneſs, but ſaid, <hi>We are cut off for our part.</hi> God hath cut us off from our Land, and caſt us into this Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.

                     <p>Others are of a different judgement, and do believe that this great Promiſe made here to the two houſes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> remains yet to be performed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

In <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. the Promiſe is, it ſhould not be ſo till <hi>Shiloh,</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſhould come, and then it ſhould; but if the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> King over both houſes united into one, the Scepter did not depart, but was advanced. This knot muſt be untyed, before we can be of their mind who ſay, This Propheſie and Promiſe was at Chriſts firſt coming ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe, the <hi>Jews</hi> do not own Chriſt; neither one houſe, nor the other do it; neither <hi>Judah</hi> nor <hi>Iſrael</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Chriſt to be the Meſſiah.

He whoſe underſtanding is infinite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. muſt needs know all things, paſt, preſent, and to come; ſhould any thing be unknown to God, his underſtanding ſhould not be infinite. Mans knowledge is borrowed from Creatures, to which he gives neither beeing, nor operation; but, God's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is from himſelf: He knows all that is poſſible in his Power, and all that is future in his Will. Creatures can neither bee, nor operate, without Him. He hath ſuch clear viſion of all things, that his knowledge muſt needs be certain: Should he be deceived in any particular, there ſhould be darkneſs in him; but, <hi>He is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prophets delivered many things which were not recorded.</hi>

                  <p>The Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpake of <hi>Gog,</hi> and yet we cannot find any direct ſatisfying place in holy Writ, concerning him. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.9. you have words cited for <hi>Jeremie's</hi> which you cannot find in all his Propheſies; the words are theſe, <hi>Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the Prophet, ſaying, And they took the</hi> 30 <hi>pieces of ſilver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Iſrael did value. Matthew</hi> ſaith not, <hi>that which was written;</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:47317:265"/> but, <hi>that which was ſpoken. Jeremy</hi> had delivered theſe words, and many other, doubtleſs, which are no where to be found. And if any ask, How came <hi>Matthew</hi> by them? He had them by Tradition, ſay ſome; others, by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſafeſt to ſay. <hi>Solomon</hi> he ſpake of Trees, from the Cedar-tree that is in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> even unto the Hyſop that ſpringeth out of the wall: He ſpake alſo of Beaſts, and of Fowls, and of Creeping things, and of Fiſhes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.33. but what he ſaid of theſe, is not to be found or known. Had not <hi>Paul</hi> helped us to that bleſſed truth of Chriſt, <hi>It is more bleſſed to give than to receive,</hi> Act. 20.35. we had never met with it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thoſe God ſends to make known his mind to men, he owns, honours, and protects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My ſervants the Prophets of Iſrael.</hi> Thoſe had ſpoken againſt <hi>Gog,</hi> and made known his mind, teaching him; God owns for his ſervants, honours them with this Title, <hi>Prophets of Iſrael;</hi> and being his, he hath a ſpecial care of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15. <hi>Do my Prophets no harm.</hi> If the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Embaſſadors of Earthly Princes be honourable, and have protection from them; much more are the ſervants and Embaſſadors of the King of Glory hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and under Divine Protection. If <hi>David</hi> would not put up the wrong done to his ſervants he ſent to <hi>Hanun,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. Neither will God let the wrongs done to his ſervants the Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go unpuniſhed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Its not an accidental or caſual thing, that enemies do come againſt the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord brought <hi>Gog</hi> againſt this People, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had propheſied many years, that God would do ſo. They made it known to the world what God had decreed to do. <hi>Gog</hi> could not have ſtir'd or mov'd one foot towards the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unleſs God had appointed and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be ſo, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.37. <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs.

                     <p>When <hi>Gog</hi> comes up againſt the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gods fury comes up in his face. <hi>Gog</hi> manifeſts himſelf to be an Enemy to <hi>Sion,</hi> and God manifeſts himſelf to be an Enemy to <hi>Gog.</hi> Wicked men plot, act, proceed far oft-times, and afflict the ſervants of God greatly; but, when they think to carry all, God appears, and that in fury. In <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.2. it is ſaid, <hi>He reſerveth wrath for his Enemies;</hi> and when they declare their enmity againſt him and his, he diſcovers his wrath againſt them. <hi>Zerah</hi> had been long plotting againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> at laſt he comes againſt them with a thouſand thouſand, and three hundred Chariots, and thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Aſa</hi> his Army and Land in a day, and whileſt he had ſuch apprehenſions, the Lord ſmote him before <hi>Aſa,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.8.12.</p>

But at the deſtruction of <hi>Gog,</hi> Heaven, Earth, Sea, all men, other creatures, ſhall ſhake. There will be more of God ſeen in that judgement then in moſt before; his preſence, power, and ſeverity will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear eminently in that Judgement; it will ſpeak aloud and fill the world with aſtoniſhment.</p>

                        <hi>As God can eaſily gather Armies for the good of his Church; ſo he can as eaſily ruine Armies which are againſt his Church: he can mingle a perverſe ſpirit amongſt them, ſo divide them that they ſhall execute one another.</hi>

The children of <hi>Ammon, Moab,</hi> and <hi>mount Seir,</hi> came againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and thought to deſtroy them, and take their poſſeſſions, but God ſoon ruined their enemies, he ſet them one againſt another; for the children of <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> ſtand up againſt the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> utterly to ſlay and deſtroy them: and when they had made an end of the Inhabitants of <hi>Seir,</hi> every one helped to deſtroy another; the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> deſtroyed the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites.</hi> This great multitude (for ſo they are called, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) did the Lord cauſe to fall by their own ſwords.

                     <p>

                     <p>He hath the <hi>peſtilence, bloud, an overflowing rain, great hailſtones, fire and brimſtone,</hi> to do the ſame by. He had an Angel to deſtroy <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.36. Stars to fight againſt <hi>Siſera, Judg.</hi> 5.20. The ſhining of the Sun upon the water, undid the <hi>Moabites,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24.

                        <hi>I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him.</hi> They thought themſelves ſafe under <hi>Gog,</hi> that they ſhould get honour and wealth in that enterprize; but, the undertaking was unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <hi>Gog</hi> could not juſtifie his act, nor protect them: They were Co-actors in wickedneſs, and ſo ſhould be Co-ſufferers. It's dangerous to adhere to Greatneſs in wicked deſigns. <hi>Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed,</hi> Prov. 11, 21. Let multitudes take <hi>Gog,</hi> and Great men by the hand; let them follow their counſels, tread in their ſteps, do their wills; this cannot ſecure them, they ſhall be puniſhed. God is no reſpecter of perſons, in every Nation he that doth wickedly, and they that joyn with him, ſhall be puniſhed.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Obſerve,</p>

Though they had not what they hoped for, yet they had more then they deſerv'd; for ſuch grand Enemies to have a burying place in that Land, which was <hi>Emanuel</hi>'s Land, out of which they would have driven his people, was no ſmall favour; eſpecially, if we add to it, that the place was nam'd after his name, <hi>The Valley of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Gog,</hi> and this recorded in the Book of God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main forever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After great Victories, wherein many are ſlain, people ſhould for publick good be careful to bury the dead; though it require time, be troubleſome, and chargeable.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>By great Victories over Enemies, God honours his own Name, and makes his people to have a name.</hi>

When God deſtroyed <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s Army, God did not only make himſelf a name, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a name, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.23. <hi>He was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the ſight of all Nations from thenceforth:</hi> and that which was his magnification, was the magnification of all his People. The honor of the Head is the honor of the whole Body: How renowned will New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be, when <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Antichriſt</hi> and all that adhere to them, ſhall be taken away? When the Lord ſhall deſtroy them by fire from Heaven, and multitudes be cut off by the Sword, then ſhall thoſe multitudes be for a name to the City.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>When <hi>Gog</hi> and his ſhall be ſubdued, then they muſt cleanſe the Land; not a dead corps, not a bone muſt be left in it; ſuch things did defile: We have had many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; but, What cleanſing hath there been in this Land? Dead bodies, limbs, and bones, of men have been buryed; but, What dead works are cleanſed out of this Land? Do not all ſorts of ſins abound, yea, ſuper-abound? Had we cleanſed the Land, for each Victory God hath given us, but of one common ſin; by this time we had been ſpotleſs, we ſhould not have had any viſible iniquities amongſt us; but now we are like <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of ſculls and dead-men; like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> or the Valley of <hi>Hamon-Gog;</hi> we ſtink ſo through our Blaſphemies, Errors, and wicked Practiſes, that paſſengers ſtop their noſes, and ſhake their heads.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>God doth execute ſome great and ſignal Judgement, when he ſummons the Creatures to eat the Fleſh, and drink the Bloud of the Slain.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It's matter of delight and pleaſure unto God, to deſtroy the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Church and People.</hi>

                        <hi>Come to my Sacrifice that I do ſacrifice for you.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> took great pleaſure in ſacrificing of Creatures unto God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.21, 22. And God was well pleaſed with Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20, 21. Here he calls the deſtroying of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> his Sacrifice, his Feaſt, or Table; he took as much delight in their ſlaughter as in any Sacrifice, or in any Feaſt. Wicked men are Bryers and Thorns, and God hath as much pleaſure in the cutting down the one, as the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman hath in cutting down the other. God delights in acts of Judgement, as well as in acts of Mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.14. <hi>He will do his pleaſure on Babylon, and his arm ſhall be on the Chaldaeans;</hi> The deſtruction of <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> God calls, His pleaſure; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>Chephzo, Voluntatem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus,</hi> his will. It's Gods will to deſtroy all the Enemies of Sion; and the doing of it pleaſes him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God is impartial in his Judicial Diſpenſations, he puniſheth the great Delinquents as well as the leſſer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mighty men, Princes, thoſe that ride in Chariots; Rams, great Goats, are ſlaughtered and given to the Fowls, and Beaſts, aſwell as the inferior ſort, the men of War, Lambs and Bullocks; They were all in the ſame confederacy, in the ſame warr againſt the Land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and God winked not at the greateſt, nor ſpared the meaneſt, but made them all a Sacrifice. God is a righteous God, and executes his judgements without reſpect of perſons. Let not great men flatter themſelves, they will not be exempted when God comes forth to judgement, though they be Princes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Great men, and vulgar ones alſo, may be a prey to the Creatures, and lye without burial for a ſeaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Princes, Mighty men, and others, after their death, lay upon the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and had their fleſh eaten, and bloud drunk by Fowls and Beaſts, which was another judgement added to the former; and the greater to the Heathen, becauſe they thought their ſouls did wander up and down upon the Earth, <hi>niſi corpora fuiſſent humata,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith. The <hi>Athenians</hi> had the buryal of the dead in ſuch honour, that if a Captain neglected to bury the dead which fell in warr, they puniſhed him with death for it. It is a great ignominy to lye unburyed. Hence the Beaſt, when the Witneſſes were kill'd, would not ſuffer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be buryed, but let them lye in the Streets, that ſo they might be the more ignominious.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God provides for the brute and dumb Creatures, and that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi>

How ſhould this teach men to depend upon God, not giving way to diſtruſt, or diſcontent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Behold the Fowls of the Air,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into Barns, yet their heavenly Father feedeth them.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord by open delivering of his People from an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, doth ſanctifie his own Name, and hath it ſanctified by others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His gathering them out of Enemies hands, declared his power, his faithfulneſs, his mercy; and thereby, he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his own Name; and theſe Attributes being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by thoſe that are delivered, and by the Nations from whom they are delivered, his Name is ſanctified. Gods People are oft under great and long afflictions, and when ever he ſets them at liberty, he ſanctifies his Name, and his Name is ſanctified; he declares himſelf, and is declared by others, to be a gracious God. When the <hi>Jews</hi> were brought out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath done great

                     <p>God will gather them, pour out his Spirit upon them, and never hide his face from them any more.

               <p>Some would have this Temple repreſented to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to be that built by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: but there is much to be ſaid to prove it not to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Temple was built in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the place where <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple ſtood; but, this Temple <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw, was to be without the City, as Interpreters obſerve from the 45. and 48. Chapters.</p>

               <p n="3">3. In <hi>Zorobabel</hi>'s Temple there was no ſuch River nor Trees yielding new fruit every moneth, as is ſpoken of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s, <hi>Ch.</hi> 47.12.</p>

               <p>There be many other things differing from what was in <hi>Moſes, Joſhuah,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s dayes. The meaſures differ much from thoſe of the Tabernacle and Temple: The Land was not divided in <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s time, as here it is to the Tribes. The Prieſts and Levites had no portion of Land, as here they have; There was no ſuch Portion or Oblation for the Prince: Their Sacrifices and Oblations are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner. The Altar, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.22. differs from the Altar of Incenſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30, 2. The cleanſing of the Sanctuary, and putting the bloud of the young Bullock upon the poſts and corners of the ſettle of the Altar, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.18, 19. is a new Ordinance, not to be found in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.

In the 25. year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the 10. day of the month, in the 14. year after the City was ſmitten, in the ſelf ſame day, Here, the Years, the Months, and Days, of the <hi>Jews</hi> captivity was obſerved of the Lord.

                        <hi>When the Church is low, in the worſt, moſt deſperate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, even then, the Lord hath a care of his Church.</hi>

When the Church is in the Wilderneſs, under perſecution, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Lord is ſolicitous for it. <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I am jealous for Jeruſalem and for Zion, with a great jealouſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Church is</hi> Mount Sion, <hi>or</hi> Mount Sion <hi>is the Church, wherein God makes known his mind for the comfort of his.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was carried in ſpirit into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſet there upon a very high Mountain, <hi>viz.

The Church is ſometimes call'd a Garden and Fountain ſealed, as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 4.12. Sometimes a Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.1. Sometimes an Houſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.

And it's ſo call'd for the hieghth, the glory, and the ſtrength of it. Mountains are high, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and ſtrong, and ſo is the Church.

Hence ſtrength and beauty are to the Church, it being ſo ſeated and ſo united. The one made Chriſt ſay, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, Mat.</hi> 16. and the other made <hi>Salomon</hi> to ſay, <hi>It was beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jeruſalem, Cant.</hi> 6.4.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Man Chriſt, who is ſinleſs and glorious, is the chief Builder, and exact Meaſurer of the Church, and things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold a Man whoſe appearance was like the appearance of Braſs, with a Line of Flax in his hand, and a Meaſuring-reed.</hi> Chriſt without ſpot, full of glory, and wiſdome, is the Maſter-builder <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>chap.</hi> 21.33. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.3. Prophets, Apoſtles, Miniſters, are his Servants, Under-officers, inſtructed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and rewarded by him. He is <hi>Architectus,</hi> the Line and Reed are in his hand, he meaſures all the Trees and Stones uſed in this Building, the outward and inward Courts with all their appurtenances: He was the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome myſtery might lye in that.</p>

                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The way into</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the Father, is by Chriſt: he ſtands in the gate of the Temple, ready to receive any ſhould come and be found fit for entrance; he had his Line and Reed in his hand to meaſure them. None unmeaſured might enter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it is that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, and no man comes to the Father, but by me.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 9. I am the Door, by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall go in and out, and find Paſture. Chriſt is the Lord of the fold, and field; by him, they enter in; by him, they are led out to the good Paſtures, and led in again. He will not ſuffer any thing that defileth, to enter into the Fold, the Temple, the New-Jeruſalem, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord Chriſt, when Divine things are preſented unto us, would have us Attent, Intent, and Apply the whole heart unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such things as are of weight, ſlightneſs and trifling about them are intolerable; therefore it's ſaid here, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, let thy ſenſes be wholly taken up with theſe things, and ſet thine heart upon all that I ſhall ſhew thee; thine heart alſo muſt be fixed upon every thing ſhewn thee, thou muſt let nothing paſs without due obſervation. As <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to do thus, about the things of his Viſion; ſo ſhould all Miniſters and Chriſtians about the things of the Goſpel, which are Revelations of the mind of God by Chriſt.

                     <p>
                        <hi>What the Lord Chriſt reveales unto his ſervants the Prophets and Miniſters, they muſt not reſerve to themſelves, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to others for their Inſtruction, Edification, and Comfort.</hi>
                     </p>

Thoſe that exerciſe Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, uſe lines and reeds to meaſure things therewith; and ſo doth Chriſt here. The line and reed in his hand, is the Word or Everlaſting Goſpel, which <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.15. is call'd a golden-reed, right, ſtrong, and inflexible; with this he meaſures the Church, and all things belong unto it; by the Word he ſets out the nature, greatneſs, power. privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and characters of the Church; by this, he meaſures out the qualifications, liberty, and power, of Members and Officers therein. Hence the Word is call'd, a Rule or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>Kene hammiddah ſheſh ammoth baammah ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophath,</hi> a reed of meaſure of ſix cubits in a cubit, and of a hand breadth. Whether theſe words <hi>an hand breadth,</hi> ſhould be joyn'd to the 6. cubits taken joyntly, or to each cubit diſtinct by it ſelf, is doubtful: that in the 43. <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 13. ſeems to make the hand's breadth to be added to each cubit, for it ſaith <hi>a cubit is a cubit, and a hands breadth.</hi> This we may underſtand of the Legal or Sanctuary cubit, not the common one, which was leſs by a hands breadth then the other, this being 5. th' other 6. hands breadth. Hence ſome deny that the hands breadth muſt be added to each cubit, for then there will be 7. cubits, thoſe 6 hands breadth making another cubit. They will have the reed 6 cubits long, and an hands breadth over, the 6. part of a cubit
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47317:302"/> more. A cubit is that length between the elbow and top of the middle finger; now this ſpace being longer in ſome men, and ſhorter in others, no certainty can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd: eſpecially, when men differ in their heads more then in their armes; for ſome make a cubit to be 5. hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls, ſome 6. ſome a yard, and ſome an ell or ells, ſome a foot and half.</p>
                     <p>The line and reed are in Chriſts hand, the virtue and benefit of them is from Him. This line and reed being the Word, hath it's efficacy from Chriſt, out of his hand it's un-efficacious, un-beneficial: but being in his hand, his power and ſpirit going with it, it meaſures out, and fits materials for this ſpiritual Building.

                     <p>Chriſt came from the Gate of the outward Wall where he firſt ſtood, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.5. and came to an inward Gate, which Expoſitors make to be the Gate of the Temple.

                     <p>Why Chriſt came to the Eaſt-gate, rather then to the North gate, this being nearer the Gate of the Wall which he entred by then the other, is queſtioned?

                  <p n="2">2. The Stability, and Firmneſs of the Church.

                  <p n="3">3. The Luſtre, and Beauty of the Church.

Tirzah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> were chief Cities in <hi>Canaan;</hi> for at one, Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> kept their Courts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.17. And at the other, Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> dwelt. Theſe Cities had much beauty, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them, and unto them Chriſt likens his Church. Certainly, the Church is the moſt beautiful, and glorious thing in the world, to them who have eyes to ſee it; many ſaw no beauty in Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. but Chriſt was beautiful, and glorious, to them who had eyes to ſee it, <hi>Joh</hi> 1.14.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47317:325"/> And many ſee no beauty, no glory in the Church of Chriſt; but where ſpiritual eyes are, there they are ſeen. The Church it ſet out by <hi>a Golden Candlestick, Rev.</hi> 1.20. and that hath luſtre, beauty, and glory. It's ſet out by <hi>a woman cloathed with the Sun, Rev.</hi> 12.1. and what luſtre, beauty, and glory can there be wanting? It's ſet out by a Bride, the Lambs Wife.

Such is the Church <hi>arayed with fine linnen, the righteouſneſs of Saints, Rev.</hi> 19 8. Such is <hi>New Jeruſalem, having the glory of God, Rev.</hi> 21.9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Safety of the Church. This Temple had a wall round about, <hi>five hundred reeds long, and five hundred reeds broad,</hi> ſufficient for the defence of it on every ſide. And the Church in the Goſpel-times hath a wall about it, long, and broad; a wall thai reacheth from Eaſt, to Weſt; from North, to South; a wall higher then the Heavens, deeper then Hell, and broader then the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> The power, and providence of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it, leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night, and day.</hi> Here is a wall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of Wood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.22. then that of Stone, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.31. then that of Iron, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.3. then that of Braſs. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.18. Such walls have been battered, and broken, undermin'd, or climb'd over; but this wall is not ſubject to any of them. The <hi>wall of New Jeruſalem, is great, and high, Rev.</hi> 21.12. ſufficient to ſecure all that be within.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Sanctity of the Church. This wall, as it was a wall of ſecurity, ſo of ſeparation; it was, to ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sanctuary, and the profane place; that thoſe in the profane place might not come into the Sanctuary, where the holy ones, and holy things were. The Church of God is a company call'd out of, and ſeparate from, the world; who have given up themſelves unto God, and Chriſt. The <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were called out of the world to be Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. And <hi>the Macedonian Churches gave up themſelves to the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. So that all the Churches of God <hi>are a

Unholy ones, who are without in the profane world, ſhould not enter into the Church. God hath ſet a wall of diſcipline to keep them out, that the Church may not be defiled by them. It's ſaid of the <hi>New Jeruſalem, That there ſhall in no wiſe any thing enter into it, that defileth:</hi> the Angels will keep them out, for at the twelve Gates thereof will be twelve Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.12. who will let none in but Saints, ſo that all her <hi>people ſhall be righteous, Iſa.</hi> 60.21.</p>

                  <p>For the 1. When it was that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had this Viſion. Not at his firſt coming to the Temple, but after he had been led from place to place, ſeen the ſeveral Gates, Courts, Chambers, Parts, Appurtenances, Ornaments of the Temple, and all exactly meaſured within, and without, after thoſe things he had this Viſion. Which inſinuates thus much, that, after men have waited upon Chriſt, followed him, and learned the nature, and condition of the Church inviſible, and viſible; then the Lord affords Viſions of himſelf, and his glory: when men come firſt to <hi>Sion,</hi> enter into Church-fellowſhip, they muſt not think to ſee the glory of God, till they are acquainted with the inward glory, and outward beauty of the Church, till they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaſuring of Chriſt therein. Thoſe that are in the Church, in due time ſee glory. It's good to be there, and to wait being there.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:47317:327"/>2. The place was <hi>at the Eaſt-gate.</hi> He was brought from the Weſt-ſide of the Temple to the Eaſt-gate, where he had this Viſion coming out of the Eaſt. Chriſt is <hi>Sol justitiae,</hi> the Sun of righteouſneſs; and the Sun's motion is from the Eaſt, Weſtward; So here, this glorious Viſion came out of the Eaſt, and entred by the Eaſt-gate, which led di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> It's the Lord Chriſt brings us out of darkneſs to light, and ſhews us the way into the Temple, and Moſt Holy place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The object, Glory. <hi>Behold! the glory of the God of Iſrael!</hi> That was, ſome figure, image, or manifeſtation, repreſenting the glory of God: In <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>Ezek. ſaw the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Throne, of a man of fire.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.18. There were viſions, where he <hi>beheld the glory of the God of Iſrael, and the glory departing;</hi> that is, ſome repreſentation of his glories, which was leaving the Temple, and them; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that God was wroth with them, and departing from them. But here the glory was coming to them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that God's wrath was laid down, their ſins pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and he gratiouſly reconciled unto them. It was ſin caus'd the glory to depart; mans wickedneſs draws the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away, but nothing in, or of man, caus'd the glory to return. It's ſaid, <hi>the glory came,</hi> it came freely, un-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, un-expectedly; there was cauſe of great mourning, when it departed; and there was as great cauſe of rejoycing, when it returned.</p>
                  <p>Whence came it? <hi>from the way of the Eaſt.</hi> Chriſt's <hi>ſtar was ſeen in the Eaſt, Mat.</hi> 2.2. His coming was from thence, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. Chriſt is call'd <hi>Tzemach,</hi> which the <hi>Septuag.</hi> render <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the <hi>Vulg. Oriens,</hi> that is, the Eaſt: Becauſe Chriſt ſhould come from heaven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the dark world, as the Sun doth, when it riſeth in the Eaſt. <hi>Luke</hi> in his 1. <hi>Chap. verſ.</hi> 78. calls Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we render <hi>the Day-ſpring,</hi> and may be rendred <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> for the day ſprings in the Eaſt firſt; be it Eaſt, or day-ſpring, it's from on High. Chriſt came from heaven to bring light into the blind world. Hence ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world,</hi> the great light, the Sun
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47317:328"/> of it; which, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſing in the Eaſt, ſhines into the utmoſt parts of the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>The next thing it, the ſign of the glory. And that was a voice, ſuch a voice, as <hi>was like the noiſe of many waters;</hi> in the 1 <hi>Chap. verſ.</hi> 24. When the Cherubims <hi>went, the noiſe of their wings, was like the noiſe of great waters.</hi> As the voice of the almighty waters, uſe to roar, and make a great noiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35. and 51.55. Such waters are ſtrong, and there is no reſiſtance of them; men cannot row, or ſail againſt them. This voice minds us of the voice of Chriſt, in the Goſpel; <hi>The ſound whereof went into all the earth, Rom.</hi> 10.18. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. Chriſt's voice is ſaid to be <hi>as the ſound of many waters;</hi> it was ſtrong, and irreſiſtible. <hi>He taught them with</hi> Majeſty, and <hi>Authority, Mat.</hi> 7.29. They <hi>were not able to anſwer him, Mat.</hi> 22.46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. not to withſtand the wiſdome, and truths he put into his diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.5. Chriſt's voice in the Goſpel, is an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious voice.</p>
                  <p>The Effects of it, were two. Firſt, <hi>The earth ſhined with his glory.</hi> Before the coming of Chriſt, the world was full of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, and Helliſh darkneſs; and <hi>Canaan</hi> was full of Types, Ceremonies, and Shadows; there was little light, or luſtre, There. But, when Chriſt came, the Oracles of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> ceas'd, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſhadows vaniſhed, and the earth ſhined with the glory of the Goſpel. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The people which ſate in darkneſs, ſaw great light: and to them which ſate in the region, and ſhadow of death, light hath ſprung up.</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> were under clouds, and darkneſs; then Chriſt came, and brought the glorious Goſpel to them. When Chriſt was born, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.9. there was <hi>glory ſhone round about</hi> the ſhephards; ſignifying, that the glory of the Lord would fill the earth, yea, all the world.</p>
                  <p>Or, this may refer to the deſtruction of Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and coming down of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> from Heaven: for of the one, it's ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.1, 2. <hi>An Angel came down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cryed mightily, with a ſtrong voice, Babylon is fallen,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> it's ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>The
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47317:328"/> glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> When theſe things be, the earth will be fill'd, and ſhine with glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ezekiel fell upon his face.</hi> The luſtre of Divine glory, ſenſe of his own frailty, and weakneſs, cauſed him to fall upon his face; here I might inlarge, but of this falling on his face, was ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.28. and the Obſervations riſing thence are there to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>The 4. thing concerning this glory, is the reſemblance of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>And it was according to the appearance of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which I ſaw, even according to the Viſion that I ſaw, when I came to destroy the City,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophet being ſent of God to propheſie the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith here, <hi>when I came to deſtroy the City.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee</hi> is, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, then had he ſuch a viſion as this was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. That which he declared to be done, he ſaith he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the City was deſtroyed, he did not put forth a finger towards deſtruction of it, he onely propheſied againſt it. So <hi>Jeremie</hi> was ſet over Nations, and Kingdomes, to root out, to pull down, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; this he did by propheſying againſt them, not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Viſion, which at firſt appeared to the Prophet in a way of judgment, appears now to him in a way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; before, it prefigured the deſtruction, here the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Temple, City, and Land. The Viſion for outward appearance, was like what he ſaw in the 1, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Chapters;</hi> but in the end, and uſe, totally differing from, yea, contrary unto, the ſame. There he ſaw God angry, <hi>the glory departing from the Temple, and going out at the Eaſt-gate:</hi> Here he ſees God ſmiling, and the glory returning the ſame way it went out; Here he beholds ſweet reconciliation between God, and the Church, made up by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The 5. thing is the Receptacle of this glory, and that was the Temple, or Houſe which had been meaſured, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>And the glory of the Lord came into the Houſe.</hi> This Houſe, or Temple, as hath been ſhew'd before, ſignified both the Body, and Church of Chriſt; for his Body-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47317:329"/> that was the Receptacle of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>For the Church, his Myſtical body; that is a Receptacle of Glory alſo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.1. <hi>The glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light, and thy God, thy glory.</hi> There is an eſtate of the Church to come, wherein it ſhall be very glorious In <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple there was glory, but glory in a cloud, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.10, 11. But in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple, there was glory without a cloud, a greater glory, even ſuch a glory <hi>as made the earth to ſhine.</hi> This is the glory which the Saints look for, and ſhall ſee in due time: <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Behold! the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is ſaid of the Church, is to be underſtood alſo of every believer, who is a Receptacle of glory, a Temple of the ſpirit of Chriſt, and God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Who ever Chriſt hath meaſured out to be a Temple, ſhall receive glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Christ.</hi> The Goſpel is a Glaſs; in it we ſee the face of Chriſt, and in his face the glory of the Lord: and <hi>are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. It's obſervable here, that when the glory of God departs from a Church, or people, it's not for perpetuity, but for a ſeaſon. The glory went out of the Temple, and City, at the beginning of <hi>Ezek.</hi> propheſie; but he ſaw the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, before the end of his propheſie. The Arke, when taken by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> cauſed <hi>Phinehas</hi> wife to name her Son <hi>Ichabod,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The glory of departed from Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.21. But after ſeven Moneths, the glory return'd again to <hi>Iſrael, Chap.</hi> 6. The Arke was ſent home, God caus'd it to return again. Long have the <hi>Jews</hi> now been without an Arke, and without glory: but in due time the glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will return unto them, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> And when the ſcaling of the 144000.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47317:329"/> out of all the Tribes ſhall be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. then ſhall they ſtand on <hi>Mount Sion</hi> with the Lamb, and ſo the glory will be in the midſt of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.</p>
                  <p>The conſequents of this Viſion, or Glory returning, come next to be conſidered: and the firſt is, the Prophets raiſing, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>So the ſpirit took me up.</hi> He was fallen upon his face, as not able to behold the brightneſs of that glory appeared; and being in that poſture, the ſpirit took him up, In <hi>Chap</hi> 2.1, 2. the Spirit ſpake to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> being down upon his face, entred into him, and ſet him upon his feet. But here he took him up, he dealt with him, as a man doth with his friend fallen: Hence ſprings this conſideration, that thoſe are humbled, and humble, with ſenſe of their own vileneſs, and weakneſs, through apprehenſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and greatneſs; ſhall ſoon be raiſed, and comforted. Sight of glory is an humbling thing. <hi>Ezek. Chap.</hi> 1.28. And here again, he was humbled upon that account; he ſaw ſo much luſtre in that glory, ſo much greatneſs in the Lord, that, convinc'd of his own vileneſs, and nothingneſs, he falls down upon his face, as being wholly unworthy to behold ſuch a ſight, to partake of ſuch mercy; but preſently the ſpirit being full of love, bowels, and compaſſion, ſteps to him, and takes him up. He ſuffers him not to lye affrighted with glory, or affected with miſery, but is a ſpeedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter unto him. The humble find mercy, and are raiſed; when the proud meet with judgment, and are thrown down.</p>
                  <p>The 2. conſequent is, <hi>The Spirit leading of him,</hi> and that was <hi>into the inner Court.</hi> He had led him into ſeveral places, and now leads him <hi>into the inner Court;</hi> whereby he came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the myſteries of, and behold the glory in the Temple, which none are able to do, without the leading of the Spirit. None, deſtitute of the Spirit, can enter into the Church, to underſtand the things thereof, and behold the glory therc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. It's the Spirit makes men diſcern ſpiritual things, it's the Spirit that leads us from knowledge to knowledge, from myſtery to myſtery, and from glory to glory; he leads into the Temple, and <hi>into the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47317:330"/> inner Court,</hi> he reveals the deep, and glorious things of God unto the Saints.</p>
                  <p>The 3. is the filling of the houſe, and that with glory, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Behold, the glory of the Lord filled the houſe.</hi> There was aboundance of glory in it, the Temple, and <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> were full of it. This leads us to conſider, not onely the Temple, re-built after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, which the Lord ſaid by <hi>Haggai, Chap.</hi> 2.7. that <hi>he would fill it with glory:</hi> And that <hi>the glory of it ſh uld be greater then of the former houſe, verſ.</hi> 9. which was fulfilled in Chriſt's bodily preſence there; but it leads us alſo unto Chriſt, who was fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See how glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The 4. thing, is the Lord ſpeaking unto <hi>Ezekiel verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>And I heard him ſpeaking unto me.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, I heard a Saying to me from the houſe, a ſaying from the glory, or from the Lord; being in that Glory which fill'd the houſe. The Temple ſaith <hi>Vatablus,</hi> the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> ſaith <hi>Maldonate;</hi> but we underſtand it of both. As the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was in the Temple, ſo the voice came from the Temple. The Lord ſpake not of the Temple, as <hi>Lyra</hi> would have it; but from, or out of, the TempIe.</p>
                  <p>The thing pointed out hereby, is this; That God reveals, and makes known his mind in his houſe, in the Church; he ſpeakes from the Temple unto his, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.6. <hi>A Voice from the Temple, a voice of the Lord.</hi> There God diſcover'd his diſpleaſure towards his enemies, and his good will towards his ſervants. <hi>In Judah is God known, Pſal.</hi> 76. There his mind is known, <hi>The law goes forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem, Iſa.</hi> 2.3. Where his Church is, there is his preſence, there he utters his voice, there he opens his mind. Why did <hi>David</hi> deſire <hi>to dwell in the houſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47317:330"/> of the Lord, all days of his life;</hi> but <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord,</hi> which appeared there eminently; <hi>and to inquire in his Temple,</hi> becauſe the Lord there ſpake, and anſwered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of his ſervants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4.

Some make this Man, to be an Angel; but it was he, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.3. <hi>The Man whoſe appearance was like the appearance of braſs, with a line of flax in his hand, and a meaſuring-reed.</hi> This was Chriſt, the Maſter-builder. <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Behold the Man whoſe name is the Branch, he ſhall grow up out of this place, and he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord.</hi> This Man ſtood by <hi>Ezek.</hi> to aſſiſt, incourage, and interpret things unto him.</p>
                     <p>Whence cometh this Obſervation,</p>

                        <hi>That the Lord Chriſt, who is the chief Architech in Temple-work, ſtands by his Prophets, and Servants who are imployed therein.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There be two things worthy notice, from the 5, and 6. <hi>verſes</hi> conſidered together.</p>
                     <p>The 1. Is the diſtinction of Subſiſtences, in the Divine Nature, and Eſſence. Here are 3. diſtinct Ones named. 1. <hi>The Spirit which took up</hi> Ezekiel. 2. <hi>The glory of the Lord,</hi> whom he <hi>heard ſpeaking out of the houſe,</hi> which was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. <hi>The Man ſtanding by him,</hi> which was Chriſt. Here is the Spirit, Father, and Son, who as they have diſtinct perſonalities, ſo diſtinct operations. The Spirits work, is <hi>raiſing up;</hi> the Fathers, <hi>ſpeaking;</hi> and the Sons, aſſiſting, or <hi>ſtanding by.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 2. thing, is the gradual proceedings of God, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on his, from mercy to mercy. Here be 5. ſteps of mercy.</p>
                     <p>The 1. Is <hi>the Spirit taking up</hi> the Prophet, being <hi>fallen upon his face.</hi> Had any one come, and raiſed the Prophet, being down; it had been kindneſs. Eſpecially, if <hi>Daniel, Zorobabel,</hi> or ſome Elder of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done it; but one greater, and better then them all did it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of God. This was great mercy.</p>
                     <p>The 2. Is the Spirit leading of him <hi>into the inner Court.</hi> He did not raiſe him, and then leave him, but led him. And whither? not <hi>into the outward Court,</hi> but <hi>into the inner Court.</hi> This was a further mercy, a choiſe mercy, to be brought ſo near the Temple.</p>
                     <p>The 3. Step, was a ſight of glory, he ſaw <hi>the glory of the Lord filling the houſe;</hi> this was a grand mercy, which none of the <hi>Jews</hi> beſides himſelf ſaw: As when Chriſt was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, and the Mountain ſhin'd with the glory of his transfiguration, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaw it, whch was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto them, to ſee ſuch glory, and the greater,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47317:331"/> becauſe none of the other Apoſtles did ſee the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The 4. Step, is the Lords <hi>ſpeaking unto</hi> him, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with glory. To have heard the voice of an Angel had been mercy; but to hear the voice of the great, and glorious God, <hi>out of the Temple;</hi> this was a height of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11.</p>
                     <p>The 5. and laſt Step, is the preſence of Chriſt; <hi>he ſtood by</hi> him. Here was another mercy, and no mean one; Chriſt <hi>In whom were hid all treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2.3. So then here was the whole Trinity imploy'd at once about <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> which was tranſcendent, and ſuperlative mercy. Thoſe are call'd to be agents in Temple-work, have need of the whole Trinity: help of the Spirit to raiſe, or led them; of a ſight of glory, to darken all humane, and mundane glory before their eyes; of hearing God ſpeak, that they may be taught of him; and of having Chriſt preſent with them, that they may be inabled to go through their work. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revel.</hi> was led from mercy to mercy, from viſion to viſion, as appears throughout that book, and eſpecially in the 21. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 2.3 &amp;c. The time will come when the Spirit will lead the Saints <hi>into the inner Court,</hi> where they ſhall ſee the glory of God, hear his voice, and find Chriſt ſtanding by them.</p>

                  <p>The promiſe of Divine preſence, and continuance, is partly in the 7. <hi>verſe, viz.</hi> in theſe words, <hi>The place of my Throne, and the place of the ſoles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midſt of the children of Iſrael for ever;</hi> and partly in the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> the laſt words of it, <hi>viz. I will dwell in the midſt of them for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>the place of God</hi>'s <hi>throne, and of the ſoles of his feet,</hi> is meant the Temple, and City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where God had formerly dwelt. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.12. <hi>A glorious high Throne, from the beginning is the place of thy Sanctuary;</hi> it was God's Throne, and it was <hi>the footstool of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.2. It's granted by all, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> having the Temple in it, repreſented the Church of God under the Goſpel, in which the promiſe here is, that God <hi>will dwell for ever.</hi> The Chriſtian Church ſhall have the preſence of God in it, and abiding with it for ever: <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. John</hi> fixes this preſence of God in the <hi>New Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3. When <hi>New Jeruſalem came down from heaven,</hi> then he <hi>heard a voice, ſaying, behold! the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.3. <hi>The Throne of God, and of the Lamb,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47317:332"/> ſhall be in it:</hi> There both God, and Chriſt will be, and dwell.</p>
                  <p>This ſets out the great eſteem God had of, and the great complacency he had in, <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> he eſteem'd it as his Throne, and took delight in it, as in his chiefeſt dwelling. <hi>Iſa</hi> 69.1. God ſaith, <hi>Heaven is his Throne, and earth his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool;</hi> this is the honour he puts upon heaven, and earth, and the ſame he puts upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and now puts upon the Chriſtian Church; It's his Throne, his Footſtool, the place he eſteems above all others, the place he takes more complacency in then all others. Such ſhall be the preſence of the Lord in it, that it ſhall be call'd <hi>Jehovah-Shammah,</hi> that is, The Lord is there, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.1. And ſuch ſhall be his content, and delight therein, that <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells you, it ſhall be call'd the <hi>Throne of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3.17. <hi>At that time they ſhall call Jeruſalem the Throne of the Lord, and all the Nations ſhall be gathered unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The effect of God's preſence, <hi>viz.</hi> ſanctification, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe words, <hi>My holy name ſhall the houſe of Iſrael no more defile, neither they, nor their Kings by their whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Of prophaning, and defiling God's holy name, was ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.20. To let that paſs, the ſenſe here is, they ſhall avoid all things which do defile; and ſanctifie God's holy name, they ſhould keep the worſh p of God, keep from idolatry, and all arbitrary inventions of men, which <hi>Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Maldonate</hi> refer to the ſtate of heaven, <hi>ad Templum Coeleſte,</hi> and not to the Temple built after the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> captivity, becauſe that was oft defiled by <hi>Antiochus, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and deſerted by the Lord. Others refer it, as is here ſaid, to that Temple; becauſe, the <hi>Jews</hi> after their captivity, did for ever hate idolatry, and ſerve the true God, though not in a right manner. If theſe words do in part refer to the ſtate of the Church after the captivity, yet princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally they refer to the ſtate of it after Chriſt, and that time too when <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be extant; for Anti-chriſt hath greatly defiled the holy name of God with his idols, and will-worſhip; but then, nothing <hi>that defileth ſhall enter, Rev.</hi> 21.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47317:333"/> 27. then ſhall be made good that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.21. <hi>In that day there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord;</hi> they ſhall be all true Iſraelites.</p>

                     <p>By whoredome, the Prophet underſtands Idolatry, which is ſpiritual whoredome, of which hath often been ſpoken.

How ſhall the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the true Chriſtians, keep the laws, and ordinances of his houſe, if it never be built? God hath not onely purpoſed, but promiſed to build it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.26, 27. <hi>I will ſet my Sanctuary in the midſt of them for evermore: My Tabernacle alſo ſhall be with them; yea, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaw it accompliſhed in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hearing God uttering parallel words, <hi>Rev</hi> 21.2, 3.

                  <p>IN the 41. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 22. <hi>verſ</hi> mention was made of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which was of the Altar of Incenſe: Here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Altar is preſented to the Prophet, which is, <hi>Altare Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſti,</hi> the Altar of Burnt-offering, which with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances of it is deſcribed, and meaſured by the Cubit; not the common Cubit, which conſiſted of <hi>twenty four</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth; but the large, or Royal Cubit, which was <hi>an hands breadth</hi> more, and is here ſaid to be the Cubit that is <hi>a Cubit and a hands breadth,</hi> by ſome call'd <hi>palmae Cubitus.</hi> This Altar was a perfect ſquare, in length and breadth equal, each was <hi>twelve Cubits; the bottome, breadth, and border,</hi> with <hi>the leſſer, and greater Settles,</hi> have their ſeveral meaſures, and diſtances; it had <hi>Horns, and Stairs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 15. <hi>verſe</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is thus, And the mount of God, four Cubits, and from the Lion of God and upwards four Horns, ſo it is in the Margent <hi>Hareel,</hi> the Mountain of God. Some underſtand <hi>Focus Altaris,</hi> the ſpace where they put the wood which burn'd the Sacrifice: Others make it the body of the Altar, which being between two Settles, or Benches; was ſo tearm'd, appearing like a little Mountain. <hi>Haariel,</hi> the Lion of God, or of the ſtrong God, it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd was the Grate upon which the <hi>Holocauſt</hi> was laid; and this Grate was of the form of a Lion, as <hi>Villalpandus</hi> ſaith; but rather it was ſo call'd, becauſe, as a Lion tears, and devours the prey, ſo the fire of this Altar did eat up the Sacrifices laid upon this Grate. Whether the Apoſtle hath not ſome reſpect unto this, or <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar for Burnt-offerings, when he ſaith, <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire, Heb.</hi> 12.29. is conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>This Altar had Stairs to go up unto it, yet God had forbid Steps, or Stairs to be make unto his Altar, and gives a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.26. which was to be obſerved of men when they made Altars unto God; but when the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the form of an Altar for himſelf, he might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47317:341"/> to his own good pleaſure, have it with Steps, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. It's probable <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Altar had Steps, being ten Cubits high, as <hi>Sanctius,</hi> and the Annotators obſerve: the Prieſts alſo were to wear linnen breeches when they were ſacrificing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Stairs looked toward the Eaſt.</hi> That ſo when they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and worſhipped God, their backs might be towards the Eaſt, and their faces Weſtward, which the wiſe God ordered ſo, that he might keep his people from conforming to, and ſymbolizing with, the Idolatrous Nations, who with their faces Eaſtward worſhipped the Sun-riſing.</p>
                  <p>This Altar for Burnt-offerings was a type of Chriſt, as thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27.1. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.1.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. It had a Grate, whereon the Sacrifice was laid; and fire put to it, whereby it was burnt. So Chriſt had a croſs, whereto he was faſtened; and there the fire of God's anger did fall upon him, which was due to us for our ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It had four Horns at the four corners thereof, which ſignified the ſtrength, and ſufficiency of Chriſt, for all who ſhould come unto him from the four corners of the earth. When men were in danger of their lives, they <hi>fled to the Altar, and took hold on the Horns thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.14. and if they were not willful, and preſumptuous ſinners, they were ſafe. What ſinners ſoever ſhall come from any part of the world unto Chriſt, and take hold of him by the hand of faith, he ſhall be ſafe. The four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Altar are his <hi>wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and <hi>He is able to ſave them take hold of him to the uttermost, Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>

This Altar was to be ſeven days cleanſed, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. of this <hi>Chapt.</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.37. and ſo it was holy, and whatſoever touched it was holy.

                  <p>Although the chief ſcope of this Viſion be to ſet out the glory, and greatneſs of the Church under the Goſpel, and among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> at this time being in <hi>Babylon</hi> were to return unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> therefore the Lord alludes to Ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rites, and Ceremonies which were well known among the <hi>Jews</hi> holding out under them the ſpiritual worſhip of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſts to be in the ſervice of this Altar, and to draw near to God, were to be of the ſeed of <hi>Zadock. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> being on his death-bed, <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-prieſt ſided with <hi>Adonijah</hi> the eldeſt Son, to make him King, but <hi>Zadock</hi> was for <hi>Solomon;</hi> whereupon after the death of <hi>David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> obtaining the Kingdome, <hi>Abiathar</hi> was put out of his place, and <hi>Zadock</hi> made High-prieſt, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Zadock</hi> was conſtant and faithful, a juſt and upright man, as his name ſignifies; and ſuch men were to ſerve at this Altar, ſuch as are conſtant to Chriſt, faithful, juſt, ſincere, ought to be in Goſpel adminiſtration, and to draw near to God in theſe Ordinances which belong to the Goſpel, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the <hi>Judaical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are three ſorts of Sacrifices mentioned, the Burnt-offering, the Sin-offering, and the Peace-offering, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18,

                  <p>As for the Burnt-offering of <hi>a young Bullock, and a Ram out of the flock, both without blemiſh, the Prieſts</hi> were to <hi>caſt ſalt upon them, verſ.</hi> 23, 24.

                     <p>What Gate ſo ever this was, it was ſhut; and therefore ſhut, becauſe the Lord had entred in by it, and no man might, but the Prince only.</p>
                     <p>Some take Prince literally for the governour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the beſt Expoſitors take it for the High-prieſt, who was preferr'd above, and ſo Prince of all the reſt: For in this <hi>Chapter</hi> he ſpeaks of the orders of the Prieſts. This Prince, or High-prieſt, was a type of Chriſt. The High-prieſt was to be without blemiſh, anointed with holy oyle, to be covered with clean linnen, and cloathed gloriouſly; on him was a plate ingraven with holineſs to the Lord, he had the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> he bare the names of the 12. Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his Breaſt, and Shoulders; as appears, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.13 <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.2. &amp; 42.36. &amp; 30.9. So Chriſt, our High-prieſt was without blemiſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. Anointed with the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. He was holy, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yea, Holineſs altogether, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.24. He had all perfection, <hi>Col,</hi> 1.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.3. He bears all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Breaſt, and on his Shoulders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                     <p>What is meant by the Gate ſhut, is neceſſary to inquire. It was not the Womb of the Virgin which was ſhut up after
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47317:346" rendition="simple:additions"/> the birth of Chriſt, as Popiſh Interpreters expound it. Some of the Antients make it to be Heavenly myſteries, which none know: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

The High-prieſt once in a year entred into the Moſt Holy place, the door opened to none but him; this typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt's opening of heaven, and entrance in thither, as is clearly expreſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 7, 8, 11, 12, 24. The Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and Temple, were repreſentations of heaven, and ſo was this Viſion of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and as the Gate here was ſhut, ſo was the Gate of heaven, till the Lord Chriſt, the Arch-biſhop of our ſouls, opened the ſame, and entred. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven, Job.</hi> 3.13. No man ever by his own virtue, or power, aſcended up to heaven, but Chriſt; <hi>Henoch,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> neither aſcended, nor entred by their own ſtrength, grace, or goodneſs. Chriſt's merits were the Key which opened heaven for them, and others. <hi>Chriſt is the door, and the way, and no man comes to the father, but by him, Job.</hi> 14.6. It's by Chriſt alone, that we come to the knowledge, and fruition of the Father; he reveals him, and his myſteries, and brings us unto the injoyment of him.</p>

In the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> no unclean thing could enter, though the Gates ſtood open: and out of heaven no clean thing ſhall be kept, though the Gate be ſhut. Chriſt hath the key to open it for Saints: He opened it for <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7.56. <hi>Behold!

                     <p>Chriſt who entred by this Gate, was not onely Man, but God: he was the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael, Jehovah,</hi> that he might open heaven for ſinners; and man, that he might enter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Gate was <hi>for the Prince,</hi> that he might <hi>ſit in it to eat bread before the Lord.

And thoſe <hi>ſerved

When they ſavour the things of the fleſh, they are brutiſh, and have on woollen garments, which ſhould not be.

They muſt be in another frame of ſpirit in their approaches to God, than in common dealings with the people.</p>
                  <p>The 2. Rule given them, is concerning their heads, <hi>They muſt not ſhave them nor wear long locks, but poll their heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47317:353"/> it would be too long; but <hi>poll</hi> the ſame, keep a medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both. The Miniſters of Chriſt muſt not <hi>ſhave their heads,</hi> leſt they ſhouid ſymbolize with Anti-chriſtian Monks, and Friars; nor wear it long, which is the garb of luxurious, barbarous, and military men; they muſt neither neglect their hair, nor be effeminate, in the length, powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or curling of the ſame; but have ſuch a care of that, and their habit, as becomes the Goſpel, and the ſervants of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>A 3. Rule is, the prohibition of Wine: nor ſimply, but <hi>when they enter into the inner Court.</hi> This was a law laid upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his ſons, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Do not drink wine, nor ſtrong drink, thou nor thy ſons with thee, when ye go into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, leſt ye die: It ſhall be a ſtatute for ever, throughout y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A 4. Rule is, touching their marriage; they are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to marry, but are caution'd about the ſame, and ſhew'd who they muſt not marry, not <hi>a widow,</hi> or one <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:47317:354"/> complains of the Prieſts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. <hi>They have violated my law, they have profaned my holy things: they have put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the holy, and profane, neither have they ſhewed</hi> (that is, to the people) <hi>difference between the clean, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> But now it ſhould be otherwiſe, the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould teach the people ſound, and diſcriminating doctrine, ſo that they ſhould know truth from error; men ſound in the faith from ſuch as were corrupt, and heretical. <hi>Paul</hi> taught <hi>Timothy</hi> to diſcern between men having a form of godlineſs, and the power of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And <hi>Titus</hi> he taught to diſtinguiſh of perſons, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. And <hi>John</hi> put <hi>difference between the clean, and the unclean, Rev.</hi> 21.27. And Chriſt taught his Apoſtles, and in them all others, that <hi>holy things must not be given unto dogs, Mat.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                  <p>The 2. Rule is, about Controverſies, and what they are to do therein: When controverſies ariſe, they are to hear, judge, and determine them by the law of God. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>In controverſies they ſhall ſtand in judgement, and ſhall judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my judgements;</hi> not according to their own wills, deſires of others, or laws of men, but as God's laws direct, and command. Chriſtians ſhould bring their differences to theis Miniſters, and Church-officers, that they may make, and maintain peace between them, judging, and determining their controverſies according to the Word of God. <hi>Paul</hi> blamed the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>brother</hi> went <hi>to law with brother, and that before unbelievers,</hi> and brought not their caſes unto the Church, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.6. Eccleſiaſtical differences onght to be decided by Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and other differences too, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>The 3. Rule, is about the ſolemn aſſemblies, and Sabbaths, <hi>they ſhall keep my laws and my ſtatutes in all mine aſſemblies, and they ſhall hallow my Sabbaths.</hi> God would not allow the Prieſts, though never ſo knowing, or holy, to do ought of their own heads in his worſhip: as they might not preſcribe worſhip it ſelf, ſo they might not alter it, nor the laws, rites, or manner of performing the ſame. Religion, and worſhip are ſuch ſacred things, that nothing humane muſt
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:47317:354"/> be intermingled with them, all things therein muſt be done according to the mind of God exactly, <hi>they ſhall keep my laws, and ſtatutes.</hi> This the Miniſters of Chriſt are to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to teach others to do the ſame; they are to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabbaths, and to ſee others do ſo too: <hi>Sanctè ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervabunt, &amp; obſervari curabunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Sa</hi> upon the place.</p>
                  <p>A 4. Rule is, direction about their dead kindred, whom they might bury, and mourn for, <hi>viz. Father or mother, ſon or daughter, brother or ſiſter,</hi> a virgin. To theſe ſix they were limited, and forbidden to be at the funerals of all others: <hi>Ne quid ex mortuis contrahant, quod aliis faſtidio futurum ſit.</hi> For thoſe of their conſanguinity they might mourn: God would not have them unnatural; yet in their mourning they might not be immoderate, nor disfigure themſelves <hi>by baldneſs, ſhaving their beards, or cutting their fleſh, Levit.</hi> 21.5. They muſt be patterns of patience unto others, and quietly ſubmit unto the hand of God, in pulling away their near relations; and becauſe it's hard in ſuch caſes to keep within bounds, and not tranſgreſs; therefore they were to offer a Sin-offering before they came to publique admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, ſhewing that ſingular purity is required in the Miniſters who are to draw near unto God.</p>

                  <p>Here is a ſpecial reaſon given, why they ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and that comfortably; it's in the 30. <hi>verſ. That he may cauſe the bleſſing to reſt in thine houſe. Junius</hi> reads it, <hi>

God would have both Prieſts, and people holy, and not defile themſelves with ſuch meats. And here it may preſent unto us the care Miniſters ſhould have of what they eat. Though all creatures be good, and lawful to eat, yet all are not wholeſome, and expedient for them who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſacred things to feed upon.

                  <p>Theſe words, <hi>When ye ſhall divide by lot, the land for inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> are thus in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> When ye ſhall make the land to fall into inheritance; that is, when ye ſhall make the lot to fall upon the land, to divide it into inheritances.

                  <p>The work of grace, and bringing of men into the Church, is free; nothing in man, or from man, procures it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>To them who have obtained like precious faith with us.</hi> The word for <hi>obtain,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Who this Prince was is doubted; for, after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> they had neither Kings, nor Princes. <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> was <hi>Governour of Judah,</hi> not King, or Prince, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.21.

                  <p>This inſinuates thus much unto us, that the Church is Chriſt's portion, and Chriſt the Protector of it.

                  <p>It's ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. that <hi>the Prince muſt prepare for himſelf, and for all the people, a Bullock for a Sin-offering.</hi> This Prince therefore ſeems not to be Chriſt, but the High-prieſt, who was ſinful, <hi>and offered firſt for himſelf, and then for the people, Heb.</hi> 7.27. Chriſt had no ſin, and ſo could not offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer hereunto, know, that Chriſt conſidered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was an immaculate <hi>Lamb without blemiſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>An High-prieſt, holy, harmleſs, undefiled, Heb.</hi> 7.26.

Our ſins were imputed to him, ſo that he ſtood as a ſinner, and malefactour in our ſtead; and offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for himſelf, that is, for his body the Church. Thus nothing hinders, but by Prince here we may underſtand Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Burnt-offering, and Sin-offering,</hi> which were to be <hi>daily,</hi> ſet out the virtue of Chriſt's death, and interceſſion, which is not for a day, or a few years, but for ever; or they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the Saints their total, and conſtant dedication of themſelves unto God, and his ſervice,</p>

                  <p>The firſt Verſe ſpeaks of the Eaſt-gate in the inner Court, that was the gate next to the Temple: By this gate the glory of the Lord, came into the Temple, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43.1, 2, 4. and it was to be kept ſhut all the ſix working days, and onely to be opened on Sabbaths and New-Moons. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. we have the reaſon why it was to be kept ſhut, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, This gate ſhall be ſhut, it ſhall not be opened, and no man ſhall enter in by it; becauſe the Lord, the God of Iſrael hath entred by it, therefore it ſhall be ſhut: That is for the Prince, &amp;c.</hi> and here it is, <hi>The Prince ſhall enter by the way, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things here required, are not to be found in the Moſaical Law; they repreſented things under the Goſpel; that Jewiſh Worſhip ſhould go down when Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The ſhutting of the gate the ſix working days tells us, that on thoſe days we are to follow our callings, and earn our daily bread: Chriſtianity doth not open a door to idleneſs; <hi>We command and exhort,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that with quietneſs men work and eat their own bread,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.12.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:47317:370"/> Under <hi>Moſes</hi> God allowed them ſix days to work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.9. and the ſame allowance they have under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.14. Some pervert Gods Order, and make all days alike, either all working days, or all Sabbaths, reſting days; but God hath diſtinguiſhed them: As there be working days wherein we muſt not reſt; ſo there be Sabbaths wherein we muſt not Work.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the gate on Sabbath days and New-Moons, ſignifies unto us, that the gate of Heaven is open unto us, when we have ſolemn and publique Meetings on the Lords day, and other ſpecial occaſions to worſhip God: When all the Diſciples were gat together to ſerve and ſeek God, then came a ſound from Heaven, and the Spirit fell upon them like fiery tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So when <hi>Peter</hi> preached unto the great multitude, the gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was opened, and power came down from above to convert three thouſand, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. So when there was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Meeting in the Centurions houſe, the Word being preached by <hi>Peter,</hi> the gate of Heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghoſt fell on all that heard the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. Such times are times of grace and mercy, God opens Heaven, and gives out bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſix days may denote the term of mans life here, which is a time of labour and ſorrow <hi>Job</hi> 5.7. and 14.1. He tumbles, or is tumbled up and down from conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to condition, and hath no reſt; but at the end of his life Heaven gate is opened, and he hath a Sabbath, an eternal reſt, where is no labour, ſin nor ſorrowing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9, 10. Then the gate of the inner Court is opened unto him, and then he ſhall ſee as he is ſeen, and know as he is known, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Here we ſee and know little, and that little darkly, as in a glaſs; but then ſhall we ſee clearly, and know perfectly the myſteries of this and other Viſions and things.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Verſe tells us of the Prince his entring by the way of the porch, and ſtanding by the poſt of the gate; where he was to worſhip, but come into the Court he might not.</p>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:47317:371"/>
                  <p>If we underſtand this of the Secular Prince, four things are here conſiderable:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Prince muſt not enter into the inner Court; he muſt not meddle with the Prieſtly Office, or things of God. Princes may not change any thing in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, abrogate or inſtitute ought by their wills or power: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> was ſmitten with the leproſie for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. and <hi>Ahaz</hi> for his adding, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. his altering, detracting and abrogating, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. was branded for his wickedneſs: They kept not at the poſt and threſhold of the gate, but entred into the inner Court.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are to countenance and maintain the Worſhip of God: The Prince muſt ſtand at the poſt of the gate, and ſee the Prieſts do their Office. He found the Burnt, Peace, and Meat Offerings; and the Prieſts prepared them, that is, fitted them for Sacrifices. The Princes and Powers of the Chriſtian World ſhould countenance, preſerve, propagate and maintain the true VVorſhip of God in their Territories. VVhen <hi>Joaſh</hi> was made King, he had the Teſtimony given unto him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.11. that was, the Book of the Law; And why was this given him? It was to inform Princes, that they ſhould rule according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; that they ſhould countenance, preſerve, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and maintain the ſame, and the VVorſhip it held forth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Princes muſt worſhip the Lord publiquely on Sabbath days, and when ſpecial occaſions are, as well as other people.</p>
                  <div type="textual_commentary">
                     <head>He ſhall worſhip at the threſhold of the gate:</head>
                     <p>Let Princes be never ſo great, rich, learned, wiſe, yet they muſt fall down at Gods foot-ſtool, ſerve him with fear, and kiſs the Son; they muſt obſerve the times of Gods VVorſhip, bow to him, and not leave all to their inferiors.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="533" facs="tcp:47317:371"/>4. They muſt not impede the Worſhip of God: The Prince ſhall go forth, but the gate ſhall not be ſhut where he hath worſhipped, he muſt not hinder oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs. It was a vile practice in thoſe who ſhut up the doors of the Lords houſe, and would not let the people or Prieſts come there to worſhip, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.24. Princes ſhould ſee to it, that the door be open for publique Worſhip, not onely at the appointed times, but upon ſpecial occaſions.</p>
                     <p>If we take the Prince here to be Chriſt, as <hi>Oecolampad.</hi> and <hi>Polanus</hi> do, then his coming to, and ſtanding by the poſt of the gate, his ſacrificing and worſhipping, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure his coming in the fleſh, and his ſtanding at the gate of Heaven for us, offering up Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for us, with ſtrong crys and tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. and whereas it is ſaid, <hi>The Prieſts ſhall prepare his burnt-offering, and his peace-offering;</hi> this preſignified the Prieſts delivering up Chriſt to be crucified for us, Luke 24.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0. <hi>The chief Prieſt and Rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him who was the Prince of life,</hi> Acts 3.15. yet he <hi>laid down his life freely,</hi> Joh. 10.17, 18. And for his <hi>worſhipping at the threſhold of the gate,</hi> it may point out that time when Chriſt being on the Croſs, ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed, and ſo bowed his head, and gave up the Ghoſt,</hi> John 19.30. Now was he at the threſhold of the gate; for he ſaid to the Thief immediately before, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23.43. Then his ſoul went forth of its earthly tabernacle; and ſhortly after reaſſuming that, he left the world, and went to his Father, <hi>John</hi> 16.28.</p>
                     <p>The gates ſtanding open until evening, that ſo the people might come and worſhip at the door of the gate before the Lord; this ſome interpret of the door of Mercy and Reconciliation which Chriſt hath ſet open for ſinners, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this life; and if they come not thither before death and worſhip God, then its ſhut for ever againſt them. On Sabbath days men ſhould draw near to God, ſeek Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him; for on ſuch days the gate is wideſt open for Grace and Mercy: On the ſix days its ſhut, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47317:372"/> is, comparatively ſhut. Chriſtians do celebrate Sabbaths and New-Moons, when they have inward ſpiritual reſt in their ſouls, through faith in Chriſt, and do receive light from him to ſee what is evil, and ſo to avoid it; and what is good, and ſo to practice it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. the Offerings, Oblations and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Prince, for the Sabbath days and New-moons are mentioned: The Ola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, or Burnt-Offering for the Sabbath was to be ſix compleat Lambs without blemiſh, and one Ram, which differs much from the appointment in <hi>Moſes</hi> days, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.9. then there were but two Lambs, here ſix are appointed: And ſo the Meat-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is larger here then there; but for the Offering in the day of the New-Moon, it was ſhort of that in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; for then two Bullocks, ſeven Lambs, and one Ram were appointed; and here one Bullock, ſix Lambs, and one Ram are nominated for the Offering; which ſhews, the Levitical VVorſhip was to be changed.</p>
                     <p>And taking the Prince for one of the Princes of the earth, it tells us, he ought to provide for the VVorſhip of God; But if we take this Prince to be Chriſt, then it imports that Chriſt hath ordained more ſpiritual, pure, and efficacious VVorſhip on Sabbaths under the Goſpel, then was under the Law, and more extenſive then was before; alſo, that Jewiſh ſhadows are fled away by the coming in of the glorious light of the Goſpel; <hi>that old things are paſt away, and all things become new, Neomen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>New-moon days were holy, and had ſpecial Sacrifices, as in this, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.11. on thoſe days they might not buy or ſell, or do worldly work, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. but they were to look unto Chriſt, of whom thoſe days were ſhadows, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. and to meditate of that light, grace and comfort comes by him. The gate of the inner Court was to ſtand open on theſe days, as well as on Sabbaths, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.

                     <p>Or theſe New-moon days and Sacrifices, may point out the renewing of the Church, and the joy thereupon. The Church after Chriſts time, was oft in the wane, in a ſuffering and declining condition; but when it hath reſt, edification, comfort, and multiplication, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. then its New-moon with it, and in a ſhort time it becomes <hi>fair as the Moon,</hi> Cant. 6.10. and ſhall be fill'd with <hi>light and joy,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 60.20.</p>

                     <p>The eighth Verſe is an Ordinance about the Princes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by the porch of the gate, and going out by the ſame way. There were divers gates to enter into the inner Court, by the North-gate, the South-gate, as well as the Eaſt-gate; and this gate was both for the Prince and the Prieſts to go in and out at.</p>
                     <p>Hence two things are obſervable:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Princes are to walk according to Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, eſpecially in matters of VVorſhip; they muſt look unto God, who hath preſcribed the way they ſhould walk in; it had been ſinful for them to have gone to the North-gate, or South-gate and worſhipped; their Princes muſt not do ought of their own wills in the things of God: It might ſeem a bondage to be tied up to the Eaſt-gate onely, and never to have ingreſs and egreſs at the other; but however, Princes themſelves muſt be ſubject to the Ordinances of Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Princes and Prieſts, Magiſtrates and Miniſters, ſhould mutually minde and care for the things of God; countenance and encourage one another therein, and each put to their helping hand to preſerve the purity and power of Religion: VVhen the Pavers go one way, and the true Miniſters of God another way, Religion doth not ſhine; when <hi>Joſiah</hi> and the Prieſts went together hand in hand one way, then there was great Reformation in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the VVorſhip of God was pure, and Religion did flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing this Prince to be the Lord Chriſt, whoſe ingreſs and egreſs was at the ſame gate, then it notes his coming from Heaven, and returning thither again, according to that of <hi>John</hi> 6.62. and 3.31. and 16.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11.</p>

                     <p>The tenth Verſe is an Ordinance for the Prince, ſhewing when he is to come to the publique Worſhip, and when he is to depart from it: When the people go in at the gate appointed for them, then muſt he go in at the gate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for him; and ſo when they go out, he muſt go out. Thoſe words, <hi>In the midſt of them,</hi> are not to be taken as if the Prince went in the midſt of the people to the Sanctuary; but they denote, that he went at that time, and when come thither, he was there with them, or among them, or at the Eaſt-gate, which is between the Nort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. Here we may ſee Princes are bound to be preſent at the publique Worſhip of God; and not onely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but to be preſent at the beginning, and to ſtay till the end thereof: They may not come and go at their own pleaſure, but at Gods appointment. The preſence of great perſons at the Worſhip of God, is of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and hath great influence into the people; it encourages them to come to hear, to ſtay, when great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then themſelves do ſo; people are led much by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Superiors; therefore Kings and Judges are

Here we are informed, taking the Prince for Chriſt, that he is in the Aſſemblies of his people; when the Saints meet together to worſhip the Lord, he is in the midſt of them. He made a precious promiſe when he was here on earth, and makes it good daily, though he be in Heaven; its that <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there in the midſt of them;</hi> to obſerve, to reward and puniſh. The Church is call'd Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. and Chriſt is ſaid to ſing praiſe unto God in the midſt of the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12.

                     <p>The eleventh Verſe treateth of the Meat-offering, which was to be at Feaſts and Solemnities, directing the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and quantities. In <hi>Moſes</hi> time the tenth part of an Ephah of flower, and the fourth part of an hin of oyl was required, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40. but here its other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, an whole Ephah of meal or flower is appointed to a Bullock, an whole Ephah to a Ram, and an whole hin of oyl to each, onely the Lambs, flewer or oyl to be offered, was left to liberty or ability.</p>
                     <p>This may teach us, that ſeeing our light and mercies are greater under the Goſpel, then theirs was under the Law, therefore our obedience and ſervice to the Lord ſhould exceed theirs; if they gave him but the tenth part of an Ephah, we ought to give him an whole Ephah; if they gave him the fourth part of an hin, we muſt give him an whole hin: The more God communicates to us, the greater returns ſhould be to him.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth Verſe mindes us of the Princes Freewil-offerings: Beſides what was enjoyned, he might volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily prepare a Burnt-offering, or a Peace-offering at his pleaſure; and at his coming one was to open the Eaſt-gate unto him, and at his going forth one was to ſhut the gate. God looks for more from Princes and great ones, then what is ordinary, then what is commanded; he looks
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:47317:375"/> for voluntary Sacrifices, Freewil-offerings at their hands. Its ſaid of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that he gave three thouſand Bullocks, three thouſand Lambs and Kids for Paſſover-offerings, and all of the Kings ſubſtance; and that the Princes gave wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.7, 8. ſo free and bountiful they were, that the Lord took notice of it, and hath recorded it in his Word, that there was no Paſſover like to that kept in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the days of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, neither did all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> keep ſuch a Paſſover as <hi>Joſiah, Verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>We may interpret this Verſe of Chriſt, and ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us not onely that Chriſt hath freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offered up himſelf a Sacrifice to God for us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14. and 10.9, 10. but that he is the ſubſtance and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of all Sacrifices; and that the Father hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gate of Heaven unto him; and that by vertue of his merits and interceſſion, the door of Reconciliation ſtands open unto us continually; but ſhould he leave Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that door ſhould be ſhut. No Patriarch, no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, no Apoſtle, no Martyr, no Saint, no Angel, ever had this honor, to have the door of Mercy and Grace opened and ſhut at their pleaſure: This is an honor pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth Verſes, declare what the daily Sacrifices ſhould be every morning, <hi>viz.</hi> A Lamb of the firſt year without blemiſh for a Burnt-offering, and a Meat-offering with it, the ſixth part of an Ephah, and the third part of an hin of oyl. The daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice here, differs from that in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Moſes</hi> requires two Lambs, the tenth part of an Ephah of flower, and the fourth part of an hin of oyl: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks but of one Lamb, the ſixth part of an Ephah of flower, and the third part of an hin of oyl: And here is no mention of the evening, which alterations imports that Moſaical Rites and Sacrifices ſhould expire; and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God would have a daily Sacrifice in the days of Chriſt; that he would be worſhipped, not onely on the Chriſtian Sabbath, but other days alſo, as was fore-propheſied,

                  <p>THeſe Verſes contain Laws to direct the Princes bounty, and to keep him from oppreſſion. 1. Here is a Law about giving to his Sons, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. What he gives them, muſt be their inheritance and poſſeſſion for ever. 2. Here is a Law about giving to his ſervants, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. If the Prince give a gift to any of his ſervants or ſubjects of his inheritance, it muſt not be theirs for ever, but onely to the year of Liberty, that was the year of Jubilee; for among the Jews, every fifty year was a year of Jubilee, <hi>Levit.</hi> 215.10. <hi>Ye ſhall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it ſhall be a Jubilee unto you, and ye ſhall return every man unto his poſſeſſion, and ye ſhall return every man unto his family.</hi> Whatſoever of mens poſſeſſions were ſold or

                  <p>The Law to prevent oppreſſion in the Prince, is in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. When Princes give gifts of inheritance to their ſons and ſervants, and are expenſive in their buildings, feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and revellings, uſually they fetch it out of the people, by ſqueezing and oppreſſing them; but the Law is, the Prince ſhall not take of the Peoples inheritance, leſt he ſhould alienate the inheritance come by Parents, from their poſterity, unto ſtrangers, and ſo cauſe them to deſert their Countrey, and to ſcatter abroad. God would have Princes to live upon, and give of their own, and by no means to oppreſs the people. Theſe Laws were not amongſt the Moſaical ones. And if the Prince here be taken for the Princes of this world, where, when, and by whom hath this Propheſie been fulfilled? where dwells the Prince, and what is his name, who hath not oppreſſed the people? We may finde the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it in Chriſt, rather then in any of them: But for them we may obſerve here;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Princes ſhould be liberal and bountiful; and not onely to their children, but to their ſervants and ſubjects, they may deſerve well at their hands, and if they be not rewarded and encouraged, men will have no hearts to publique, honorable, and difficult imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When <hi>David</hi> ſhall have <hi>Sauls</hi> Daughter, he will venture upon the Philiſtines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Princes being bountiful, muſt give of what is their own: It's injuſtice and diſhonorable to them, to give away what is anothers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ought to be well content with their own eſtates, and not to covet and take away from others their goods, houſes, or poſſeſſions; they ſhould not ſpoil their ſubjects of their right, thruſt them out of their poſſeſſions, take away their Priviledges, to make themſelves great, rich, dreadful: When Princes do ſo,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:47317:377"/> they become Tyrants, and Oppreſſors, and their ends will be breaking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.4. <hi>He ſhall break in pieces the oppreſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſpeak ſomewhat of this Prince, as pointing out Chriſt: He hath ſons and ſervants, to the one he gives graces, to the other common gifts: To his ſons he gives a Kingdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29. to the wicked who are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he gives a portion in this life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. And at their death the time of liberty, and at the time of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, the gifts return to the Prince again; but the Graces and the Kingdom are the Saints for ever, they are their inheritance. This Prince gives of his own; for all that the Father hath are his, <hi>John</hi> 16.5. and he is heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.28. and he gives bountifully, he pours out his Spirit upon his Sons, and fills them with joy glorious and unſpeakable.</p>

                        <p>In the four corners of the Court, there were Courts joyned of forty cubits long, and thirty broad; theſe four corners were of one meaſure.</p>
                        <p>And there was a new building round about in them, round about them four; and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.</p>

                  <p>THe Courts and places where the Prieſts and Levites boiled, baked, and made ready the Sacrifices, are here deſcribed unto us. On the North-ſide of the Prieſts Court, into which the Prince and People were not to enter, were the holy Chambers; and Weſtward from them was a place as far from the Eaſt-gate as might be, where all things were fitted for boiling and baking the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; in that place were the Kitchins for ſuch ſervice. Hither was the Prophet brought to ſee theſe, and from hence he was carried into the utter Court. Some make this utter Court the Gentiles or Peoples Court; others, the middle Court, called the utter Court, becauſe it was ſo to the inner Court.</p>

                     <p>The Temple was upon an high Mountain, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.2. therefore the waters are ſaid to come down; and they came from the right ſide of the Houſe, that was the South-ſide; for the front of the Houſe ſtanding towards the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:47317:379"/> Eaſt, when a man ſtood and lookt Eaſt-ward, his right hand or ſide was towards the South.</p>
                     <p>The Altar for Burnt-offering was before the porch of the Temple, and at the South-ſide thereof did theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters run.</p>
                     <p>Our Prophet having ſeen the ſpring and rice of the waters, is led out of the inner Court, by the way of the North-gate, and brought to the uttermoſt Eaſt-gate, where he firſt entred; and it was to behold how the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ran out there on the right ſide alſo: The words in Hebrew are, <hi>Maiim mepaccim, aquae phialantes; peccah,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to flow, but <hi>lente tanquam e phiala manando,</hi> he ſaw the waters run there gently and pleaſingly; they run not fiercely as a torrent, but gently, as oyl poured out of a vial.</p>
                     <p>Theſe waters, though they run gently, yet increaſed mightily; for upon Chriſts meaſuring out a thouſand cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, they became waters of the ancles; upon his meaſuring out the two thouſand cubits, they roſe to be waters of the knees; upon his meaſuring out the third thouſand of cubits, they aſcended to be waters of the loyns; and upon meaſuring the fourth thouſand, they became wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for ſwimming, they could not be waded through, they were ſo deep, even a great River impaſſible.</p>
                     <p>What theſe waters do ſignifie is worthy enquiry: Some make theſe wate s to ſignifie the proſperity of the Church, that great happineſs which the Jews had after their return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> This was an outward mercy, and but for a little ſeaſon, for they ſuffered great and grievous things by <hi>Antiochus</hi> and others, in the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi> times: But here ſome ſpiritual mercy is intended by the waters; others therefore underſtand by them, the waters of Baptiſm, which Chriſt inſtituted, and ſo came from the Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſide of Chriſt; but theſe waters are too ſhallow to be <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters. A third ſort make them to be the Spirit, and gifts of the Spirit: Its true, the Spirit is ſaid to be <hi>poured out,</hi> Joel. 2.28. but its not to be underſtood of the perſon of the Spirit, which is
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:47317:380"/> infinite, indiviſible and immoveable; but of the gifts and graces of the Spirit, with ſuch, with him who ſaith, <hi>Per aquas iſtas gratiae, &amp; benedictiones divinae quibus in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia dei frumitur, deſignantur.</hi> A fourth ſort interpret theſe Waters of the Goſpel, the glad tidings touching mans ſalvation by Chriſt, which is compared to water frequently in Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. <hi>The earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea:</hi> The knowledge of the Lord Jeſus ſhall abound, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sea; ſee <hi>Joel.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8. We may take the Goſpel, with the gifts and graces of the Spirit to be theſe waters; for the Goſpel is <hi>veliculum Spiritus,</hi> the miniſtration of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. And the Spirit, with the graces and gifts, are oft compared to water as well as the Goſpel; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. and 41.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>John</hi> 4.14. and 7.37, 38, 39. Now it remains to ſhew wherein they are like unto water.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Water cleanſeth, it purges away the filth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and other things: So doth the Goſpel, with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, cleanſe the ſouls of men, and purge their hearts from ſin and filthineſs, <hi>John</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now ye are clean through the word which I have ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> Chriſt ſpoke unto them the Goſpel, and that was the word, together with the Spirit, which made them clean from their unbelief, diſobedience, and other ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit:</hi> The Spirit accompanying the Goſpel, purified their ſouls, and made them obedient to the truth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.36.25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Water moiſtens and ſoftens the earth, which before was dry and hard, ſo that there was no entrance for the plow; but being well watered with the rain of Heaven, its ſoft, and fit for the plow: So the Goſpel, the Doctrine of Chriſt, moiſtens and mollifies hard and heavy hearts. Thoſe that put Chriſt to death, were hard-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but when they heard <hi>Peter</hi> preach the Goſpel, and ſome of that water fell upon their hearts, they were
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:47317:380"/> ſoftned, and became ſenſible of what they had done; <hi>They were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2.37. So <hi>Paul</hi> was a ſtout and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born fellow, but the water of the Goſpel did ſo ſupple him, that it made him yield and ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Water cools heat; the heat of the earth and air in Summer, and heat of the body in hot weather: Many bathe themſelves in the water, to cool them: <hi>Dives</hi> begg'd a little water to cool his tongue, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24. The waters of the Goſpel have a cooling vertue in them, they cool the heat of perſecution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. they cool the heat of our paſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>James</hi> 3.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. they cool the heat of temptations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>James</hi> 12.12. they cool the heat of our luſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. they cool the ſcorchings of a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and fire of Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. and 11.28. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Water makes the earth fruitful: When they wanted rain, there was barrenneſs and famine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. but when they had the former and latter rain, all things flouriſhed and abounded, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26, 27. <hi>I will cauſe the ſhower to come down in his ſeaſon, there ſhall be ſhowers of bleſſings; and the tree of the field ſhall yield her fruit, &amp;c.</hi> Litterally theſe words are true, and ſpiritually alſo, and ſet out the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thoſe who were to live under the ſweet ſhowers of Goſpel Doctrine. They ſhould be like a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered garden, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. The doctrine of the Lord is as the rain and dew, which falling upon the tender herbs and graſs, cauſes them to grow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.1. When <hi>Zacheus</hi> was watered with this water, he became very fruitful, and gave half of his goods to the poor, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. others ſold all, and laid the money down at the Apoſtles feet, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.35. They were abundant in love, and in good works.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Water quencheth thirſt, ſatisfies and revives the thirſty ſoul: It was their drink in the infancy of the World, and is ſtill in ſome hot Countreys. <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
                        <pb n="552" facs="tcp:47317:381"/> when like to periſh for thirſt, having ſome water out of the jaw-bone of an Aſs, he revived, and was ſatisfied, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.18, 19. The waters of the Goſpel have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty alſo, when the ſoul is a thirſt, there is no water quenceth that thirſt, but the water of life, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſheweth and conveyeth unto us. The Goſpel hath this water of life in it: Chriſt and the Spirit, which it makes men partakers of. The great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are ſatisfying things; the righteouſneſs and Spirit of Chriſt are ſatisfying and reviving things. <hi>Peter</hi> found it ſo, when he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhould we go? thou haſt the words of eternal life:</hi> Let others go to what Brooks, Pits, or Ciſterns they will, to quench their thirſt, we will never go from thee, who haſt the words of eternal life; who art the Fountain of living Waters, and canſt ſatiſfie us for ever, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. This Water quencheth unlawful deſires, and ſatisfieth Spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Some waters have a curing and healing vertue: The Pool of <hi>Betheſdah</hi> healed all manner of diſeaſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. There be waters in our Land which have healing vertue in them: Such be the waters here mentioned, for they healed other waters, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Goſpel waters will heal ſick ſouls and bodies. The Centurion ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, ſpeak thou but the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils with his word, and healed all that were ſick, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. The Goſpel is not onely a pattern of wholeſome words, but of healing words; alſo there is no ſpiritual diſeaſe in the ſoul, but the Goſpel hath healing vertue to cure it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the <hi>Goſpel of Salvation,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13. and <hi>the power of God unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Some waters are very cordial, and do greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſpirits of man: None more then the waters of the Goſpel, by which the Spirit, the true, ſolid &amp; eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter flows into the heart. The Goſpel, and good things of it, are ſet out by Water, Milk and Wine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. all which are comforting things: The Goſpel is glad-tidings,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:47317:381"/> and affords ſtrong and everlaſting conſolation to the ſoul, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, the Word of God <hi>was the joy and rejoycing of his ſoul,</hi> chap. 15.16. <hi>David</hi> profeſſes, he had periſhed in his affliction, had he not drunk of theſe Cordial Waters, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.92.</p>
                     <p>To come to thoſe Obſervations which we may pick out of theſe Verſes.</p>
                     <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That as it is Chriſt who makes known the things of the Temple; ſo he doth the ſame not all at once, but he makes known ſome at one time, ſome at another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Formerly Chriſt had revealed much to the Prophet, and here he brings him again to the door of the Houſe, and ſhews him waters he had not ſeen before. We are not capable of much at once; like children, we muſt have line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is inſtructed a little in one place, and a little in another place, as he was capable: So Chriſt the wiſe and chief Builder of the Temple, deals with him, and revealed one thing after another unto him; and ſo he dealt with his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.12.</p>
                     <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>The waters of the Goſpel, the gifts and graces of the Spirit, do fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The bitter waters of the Law flowed from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but the ſweet waters of the Goſpel flowed from Mount <hi>Sion. Iſaiah</hi> long before propheſied whence theſe waters ſhould come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Out of Sion ſhall go forth the Law;</hi> that is, the Law of Faith, not of Works, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> So in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.8. <hi>And it ſhall be in that day, that living waters ſhall go out from Jeruſalem; half of them towards the former ſea, that is Eaſt-ward; and half of them towards the hinder ſea, that is Weſt-ward:</hi> In Summer, and in Winter ſhall it be, there ſhall be no time wherein theſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-waters ſhall ceaſe flowing. It
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:47317:382"/> is not <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other City in the World, which hath the honor to ſend out theſe waters, but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> onely, where was the true Church of God.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt tells us, <hi>He is the the door,</hi> John 10.7. All ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al water is in him, all Heavenly Doctrine, all gifts and graces: When the Spirit moved holy men to ſpeak, as it is 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. it received of Chriſt, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, <hi>John</hi> 16.14. and all the waters which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Apoſtles, they received from Chriſt: The Spirit was given them to fill their veſſels, and fitted them to carry theſe living waters from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all parts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.8. and Chriſt ſent them forth to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. and he that believes in him, receives living waters from him; all gifts, graces and divine truths, are from him: The waters of the Sanctuary, flow from the Lord of the Sanctuary.</p>

                     <p>They worſhipped with their faces towards the Eaſt, that was the Nations practice.

When ſome Jews, degenerated into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh cuſtoms, did worſhip with their faces towards the Eaſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. and their backs towards the Temple, God counted it an abomination, it did greatly provoke him, cauſing him to deal in fury with them, and to ſhew them no pity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.17, 18. God muſt be worſhipped according to his own order, and not after the rites and cuſtoms of others.</p>

                     <p>Theſe waters are ſaid to flow from the Altar, which was a type of Chriſt: The Sacrifices offered upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, were for Reconciliation; and Chriſt being both Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Sacrifice, hath reconciled man to God; and as he doth this, ſo the Waters flow from him, ſo Goſpel-truths are given out by him. The Goſpel is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the death of Chriſt, ſeal'd with his blood, and holds out ſtrong arguments of our being reconciled to God; and therefore it is called <hi>The Goſpel of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 6.15.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Obſervations from the two firſt Verſes: Now for thoſe that flow from the other three Verſes.</p>

                     <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>The motion of Sanctuary-waters is not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, or Humane, but according to Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

Chriſt had meaſured out a thouſand cubits there, for theſe ſpiritual Waters to flow. It is at the Appointment of Chriſt what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, what Cities, what Towns, and what Families ſhall have theſe waters.</p>
                     <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>That as it is at Chriſts Appointment to what places theſe waters ſhall flow, ſo likewiſe how far therein they ſhall flow.</hi>

                     <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>The Doctrine of the Goſpel is never rightly underſtood, unleſs we be taught it by Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He led <hi>Ezekiel</hi> into the waters of the Sanctuary; ſo is the Hebrew <hi>bammaiim,</hi> and we read it, <hi>through them:</hi>
                        <pb n="558" facs="tcp:47317:384"/> He inſtructed him in the nature and qualities of them. Whoſoever underſtands the Goſpel ſavingly, is led into that knowledge by the Spirit of Chriſt: The Apoſtles themſelves had not underſtood the Goſpel, had not Chriſt ſent them his Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>When he the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth;</hi> that is, he will make you know all truth ſavingly. The truths of Chriſt are ſpiritual, and without the Spirit they are not diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. Many wade into theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual waters without Chriſt and his Spirit, and they are of thoſe who are ſaid to be ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                     <p>Obſerv. 5. <hi>The Doctrine of the Goſpel, converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and graces of the Spirit, proceedeth gradually.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Doctrine of the Goſpel, that went out gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, like water out of a fountain, which may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ones hand, or a diſh, but running a little way encreaſes; the waters hereafter a little time and motion, were up to the ancles, after to the knees, and then to the loyns: The Goſpel was not given out all at once, but one truth thereof after another: Chriſt himſelf firſt preached one part of the Goſpel, and then another; he was four years and upwards in letting that ſacred water run out of his lips, it came from him by degrees: And ſo the Apoſtles, who were Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>uits of this Fountain, let out that water little by little; they went up and down preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here and there, writing an Epiſtle to one place, and an Epiſtle to another place, till they fill'd the World with theſe waters. If you read the Book of <hi>The Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> you may ſee how the Goſpel ſpread from place to place, and what great progreſs it had in the world. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 10.18. their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world; and to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. he declares, the Goſpel was come unto them, and to all the world; from ſmall beginnings here was great encreaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="559" facs="tcp:47317:384"/>2. The converſion of ſinners is a gradual work: Now one is converted, then another, afterward a third, not all at once. Though the Waters of the Sanctuary be living waters, yet they do not beget life in all who taſte of them: Many Scribes, and Phariſees, and others, heard Chriſt preach the glad tidings of the Goſpel, and ſpeak as never man ſpake, yet were not converted; ſome few were wrought upon in Chriſts time, in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſome by the Apoſtles in ſeveral places where they came, as at <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Philippi,</hi> and other places; but the moſt part remained unconverted, even in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf; which made Chriſt weep over it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. and ſay, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how oft would I have gathered thy children together, even as an Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</hi> Mat. 23. Converſion-work went out ſlowly in Chriſts days; it was quicker in <hi>Peters</hi> time then ever ſince, three thouſand ſouls converted at a Sermon; now three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sermons hardly convert one ſoul. <hi>Paul</hi> gat at one time a <hi>Lydia,</hi> at another a Jaylor, at a third time a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſervant; and ſo by degrees the waters of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary did good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The graces of the Spirit have a gradualneſs in them: Their knowledge, their faith, their hope, their love, are little at firſt; but in time they encreaſe, they grow from knowledge to knowledge, from faith to faith, from hope to hope, and from love to love: None are fill'd with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary-water at firſt, they come into us little by little, drop by drop: <hi>Apollos</hi> was more perfectly inſtructed in the way of God by <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> Act. 18.26. There be ſeveral ages in Chriſtianity, Babes, Children, Young Men, Fathers: Babes are onely ſprinkled with theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; in Children, they are come to their ancles; in young men, to their knees; and in Fathers, they are up to their loyns, and drawing near to their chins, they are almoſt come to perfection; but they and the others muſt ſtill <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, till they all come to a Perfect

                     <p>Obſerv. 6. <hi>The Goſpel hath ſuch depths and myſteries in it, as no Humane underſtanding can ſound or comprehend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The waters of the Sanctuary did riſe ſo high, become ſo deep, that they could not be paſſed over: Swim in them <hi>Ezekiel</hi> might, but he could neither finde the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of them, nor get over them. The Goſpel is among the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. it is the richeſt box of the knowledge and wiſdom of God, and there is a depth in thoſe riches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>it is the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3 8. <hi>it is wiſdom from above,</hi> Jam. 3.17. it is a Doctrine of heavenly things, <hi>John</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. it is not known without the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. neither Chriſt nor his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are known without Revelation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16.

Are not theſe myſteries and depths in the Goſpel, that three ſhould be one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. that two ſhould be one, and yet continue two ſtill! that the Maker ſhould be one with the thing made! that he who bleſſeth all, ſhould himſelf be a curſe! that the Prince of life ſhould dye! that the debt ſhould be paid, and yet pardoned; the fault be puniſhed, and yet remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! that the Head and Members of the ſame Body ſhould be in Heaven, and on Earth, and in the ſeveral quarters of the World, at the ſame time! that God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, ſhould dwell in man!

                     <p>The waters of the Sanctuary are holy waters, and a River great and deep, which none can paſs over: No waters are like theſe for purity and perfection; they are not like the muddy waters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or puddle waters of <hi>Rome;</hi> they are pure, without all mixture, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all that belong to the Sanctuary: So that men need not run to pits or ciſterns of their own, or others.

There is a Corporal fight, and there is an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual ſight; ſee with the eye of thy body, and with the eye of thy minde.</p>
                  <p>Note hence, <hi>That the waters of the Sanctuary have that in them which is obſervable to be conſidered, and ſeriouſly weighed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haſt thou ſeen this?</hi> How ſuddenly theſe waters break forth? how they have followed the meaſuring line, which way ſoever it went? how in a little time they have riſen up to a River, and ſuch a River as is impermeable? Haſt thou ſeen the myſteries contained in theſe waters? As the waters abound, ſo the myſteries thereof abound. The Goſpel is full of myſteries and depths; the beginnings, encreaſe, and ſucceſs of it are wonderful things, and ought to be minded; the ſpreading, converting, and edifying power of the Goſpel, Chriſtians ſhould take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of, rejoyce at, and bleſs God for: It is a choice mercy to have the waters of the Goſpel in a land,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:47317:387"/> or in a town; and what a mercy is it when theſe waters prove waters of life, to convert and edifie thoſe that are there? If <hi>Middletons</hi> and <hi>Thames</hi> waters are obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, much more myſtical waters.</p>
                  <p>After this queſtion comes action; the Lord brought him, and cauſed him to return to the brink of the River, or tip of it. Hitherto he had ſeen the waters; now the Lord would have him to ſee what was upon the banks or ſides of the River; for as there were things conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the waters, ſo on the banks.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>Chriſt reveals and makes known the myſteries of the Sanctuary by degrees, and one after another.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſees the waters, and being taught ſomething concerning them, he is brought to the brink of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and hath new myſteries preſented to him; he is held from ſeeing the waters of the Sanctuary, to behold the trees thereof.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>The Scholars of Chriſt ought to be content with what it pleaſes the Lord Chriſt to make known unto them, and to reſt ſatisfied therewith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> troubles not himſelf or Chriſt about the depth of the River, the multitude of waters, and ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurings; but being ſet down on the brink of the River, he is content to ſee and hear what the Lord ſhould ſhew him, and ſpeak unto him. There is an itch in man to know things kept ſecret and hidden: Many through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity prying into ſuch things, have prejudiced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Eve</hi> did ſo. Let us acquieſce in what Chriſt reveals, and not thirſt after hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, leſt we meet with Satanical deluſions, and be given up to believe lyes.</p>

<pb n="565" facs="tcp:47317:387"/> watres were myſtical, ſo are theſe trees, and they have a myſticall and ſpiritual ſignification: They ſignifie the Saints under the Goſpel, thoſe that are true Chriſtians, and ſuch are not unfitly compared to trees, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them in many reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Trees have life in them; ſo true Chriſtians have life in them. When the Romans were become Chriſtians; then they <hi>were alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.11. before they were dry and dead trees, as the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> were, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.

                  <p n="2">2. Trees are rooted <hi>in ſolido,</hi> in the firm earth, in Rocks and Mountains; and true Chriſtians are rooted in Chriſt, who is a firm and ſolid Rock. The <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were ooted in Chriſt; not in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> or Humane Philoſophy, but in Chriſt and his Doctrine; they were eſtabliſhed in the faith of Chriſt, ſo that none could pull them from him, <hi>John</hi> 10.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Trees draw ſap, moiſture and vertue from the earth, and the waters they are near unto, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.16. The trees of the Lord are full of ſap, they draw ſtrongly: And ſo it is with true Chriſtians, Metaphorical trees, they draw ſap from Chriſt, Vertue from his Promiſes, and Moiſture from his Ordinances. Faith and Love are like the little fibres which are upon roots; thoſe ſtrings, veins or ſinews draw mightily, and communicate to the whole; ſo doth Faith and Love abundantly bring in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſap into the ſoul, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received,</hi> John 15.5.</p>

The <hi>Philippians</hi> were filled with fruits of righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Dorcas</hi> was full of good works and alms-deeds which ſhe did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.36. the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> abounded in liberality, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. and the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in every thing, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſome had tongues, ſome interpreted, ſome wrought miracles, and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied.

                     <p>Theſe are the places into which the waters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary did run.

Hither the Sanctuary waters came, and they went down alſo into the Deſart, that is, ſay ſome Expoſitors, into the Mediterranean Sea, which was in the Weſt, ſuitable to which interpretation ſeems that in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.8. where living waters are ſaid to go out from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> half of them toward the former ſea, that is, the Salt or dead ſea; and half of them towards the hinder ſea, that is, the Mediterranean ſea. Others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe waters of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did run onely Eaſt-ward, firſt into the dead ſea, and then out of that into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts or Plains of <hi>Moab;</hi> for here is not mention of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                     </p>
                     <p>The effects of theſe waters are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Healing: When they came into the dead ſea, they healed the waters thereof; the Sanctuary waters made thoſe deadly waters <hi>ſalubres &amp; utiles,</hi> wholeſome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as the bitter waters of <hi>Marah</hi> were healed by a tree thrown in, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. and the waters of <hi>Jericho</hi> by a cruſe of ſalt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Production of Fiſhes, and them in abundance: Theſe waters were fruitful waters, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. they begat life in dead creatures, and cauſed Fiſh to abound as the Fiſh of the Sea, exceeding many, as it is in the end of <hi>ver.</hi> 10. By Fiſh underſtand, thoſe that are wrought upon, and brought in by the Goſpel: And they are ſo called,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe as Fiſh are generated of Spawn, or Seed and Water; ſo Believers are born of Water and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>John</hi> 3.5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Fiſh its conceived were not under the curſe that fell upon the earth, and things upon it, not on the waters and fiſh therein; ſo Believers are not under the curſe of the Law: Unbelievers are under condemnation and wrath, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 36. but Believers are free from both.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They keep freſh in ſalt and brackiſh waters; and true Converts do ſo: When there are brackiſh, corrupt doctrines abroad, hot and fierce perſecutions, by reaſon of them, the ſound Believer is not tainted with them; <hi>Arianiſm, Pelagianiſm, Familiſm, Rantiſm</hi> and <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> do not corrupt them; and the greater troubles they meet with, the more lively they are.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some Fiſh ſwim conſtantly againſt the ſtream: Such are true Chriſtians, they ſwim againſt the ſtream, they are not led by the multitude: There be ſeveral ſtreams, one of Prophaneſs, another of Flattery, a third of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, a fourth of Lukewarmneſs and Formality, a fifth of Carnal policy, a ſixth of Self-ſeeking: Againſt all theſe, and many others, doth the ſincere Chriſtian ſwim and row daily.</p>

                        <pb n="569" facs="tcp:47317:389"/>5. Fiſh live in and by the waters, they cannot live <hi>in arido,</hi> they preſently dye without water: And true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians they live in and by the waters of the Sanctuary, they live in and by the Spirit, they drink in the waters of the Goſpel: Theſe ſpritual Fiſh cannot live without them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. there is a pure River of water of life, wherein theſe live and ſwim.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Fiſh of the ſame kinde do ſort together: It is ſo with true Converts, they leave their old company, and ſort with thoſe that are regenerate and godly. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee.</hi> Chriſts Diſciples gate together, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went to their own company, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.23.</p>

                     <p>The Hebrew for <hi>one as well as another,</hi> is, a man as his Brother, which is uſual among the Hebrews: For when they ſpeak of two or more in the <hi>maſculine gender,</hi> they ſay, <hi>vir &amp; frater ejus;</hi> and when they ſpeak of two or more in the <hi>faeminin gender,</hi> they ſay, <hi>uxor &amp; ſoror ejus;</hi> the ſenſe here is, that they ſhould all <hi>aequo jure</hi> poſſeſs the Land, and each Tribe have an equal portion, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers much from the diviſion made of old; for <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.54. <hi>Ye ſhall divide the Land by lot, for an inheritance among the families; and to the more ye ſhall give the more inheritance; and to the fewer ye ſhall give the leſs inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> And if we grant with ſome, that it was ſo here, that a greater portion of land was given to the greater Tribe, yet it is conceived from theſe words of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that every one in each Tribe had an equal portion, which was not ſo of old.</p>

<pb n="583" facs="tcp:47317:396"/> and true Iſraelites, were not to be in this Church: Hypocrites, ſcandalous, ignorant, and unregenerate perſons, are often in, if not the major part of particular viſible Churches; but of the univerſal Church of Chriſt they are not; that conſiſts of true Iſraelites, ſuch as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was, <hi>John</hi> 1.48. of Jews inwardly, ſuch as are circumciſed in heart and ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. of ſuch as are enrolled in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 23. of ſealed ones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. and theſe ſtood with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion, Rev.</hi> 14.1.

The truth of what our Lord Chriſt hath given out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.30. <hi>The laſt ſhall be firſt; Dan</hi> was the laſt, and here he is the firſt; he hath the honor and preheminence above the reſt. <hi>David</hi> was the youngeſt and laſt of <hi>Jeſſes</hi> ſons, and he was made the firſt, being anointed to be King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11, 12, 13, 14. Thoſe workers in the vineyard, the Lord ordered that his Steward ſhould pay the laſt firſt, and the firſt laſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.8, 16. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.30. <hi>There are laſt which ſhall be firſt;</hi> the Gentiles were laſt in the Jews account, but God made them firſt: <hi>and there are firſt which ſhall be laſt;</hi> the Jews were firſt in their own eyes, but they were made laſt and of no eſteem in the eyes of God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. The publican who was laſt in the account of the Phariſee, was firſt in the account of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe that have deſerted God and his ways, gone far and long from him, may find mercy, repent and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to favour. Theſe <hi>Danites</hi> met with mercy from God, repented them of their Idolatry, and returned to him again, elſe they had never been honored ſo far as to be ſet in the firſt place. When great ſinners come unto God, who were looked upon as the laſt and worſt of men, God doth not onely pardon them, but oft-times honors them and makes them the firſt; as <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>He is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Iſrael:</hi> He had been a great perſecutor, blaſphemous, injurious, but when he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Faith of Chriſt, he was made the cheif of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God of his good pleaſure and free grace, calls and recalls whom he will. Theſe <hi>Danites</hi> had nothing in them
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:47317:399"/> to move God to own them for his people at firſt; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to move him to recall them, being degenerate and fallen into idolatrous paſſages, unleſs we make wickedneſs an argument thereunto; and if ſo, there is ſufficient of that in the Devils to move the Lord to ſhew mercy; but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs provokes to deſtroy, not to ſhew mercy. The beſt thing in man induceth not God to ſhew mercy; that is from his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15.

<pb n="600" facs="tcp:47317:405"/> reeds, which make one hundred and eight thouſand cubits, and eighteen thouſand hands breadth; and after this account every ſide of the City is eight miles, and one hundred paces; for eighteen thouſand reeds make thirty two miles and four hundred paces, as <hi>A Lapide</hi> obſerves. So that this City was very large. Others leſſen the City greatly, and make the meaſures to be onely cubits, and ſo each ſide of the City comes to be a mile and almoſt a half long, which was no great length nor breadth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both equal. <hi>Naffenrefferus</hi> makes the meaſures to be cubits, and inſiſts upon it much; but others are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judgement from him. And ſeeing the City in the <hi>Revelations</hi> was meaſured by the reed, it ſeems alſo more then probable that this alſo was meaſured by the ſame meaſure. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.15, 16. <hi>he meaſured the City with a reed twelve thouſand furlongs.</hi> As <hi>Ezekiels</hi> City exceeded the former City much, ſo <hi>Johns</hi> City exceeded <hi>Ezekiels</hi> far more; for being ſquare, as the other was, it had three thouſand furlongs on each ſide, which make three hundred ſeventy and fivemiles, reckoning eight furlongs to a mile; So that this City being three hundred ſeventy and five miles in length, and as many in breadth, was the beſt City that ever was.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its diſcribed from the gates of it.

                     <p>What is meant by this City, is of concernment to know. Some by it underſtand Jeruſalem litterally, as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built by the Jews after their return, together with the civil ſtate in which the Prince governed by civil Laws, juſt Weights and meaſures; but ſuch a City as is here deſcribed, was never built by the Jews after their captivity. To let that opinion paſs, ſome do make this City <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw to be a moddle and platform of that City, the Jews (who ſhould be called, converted, and brought to their own land again) ſhould build and inhabit; but becauſe the Jews return to their own land is denyed by ſome, queſtioned by many, and doubted by moſt, whither ever a City as that here is held out, <hi>viz.</hi> of thirty two miles compaſs, ſhall be built by them, it is ſafeſt to interpret this City typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and in this ſenſe Interpreters are not all of a mind; for ſome make it to be a repreſentative of Heaven, and the amplitude or graces thereof; others make it to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Church under the Goſpel, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times thereof eſpecially, yet ſhort of that City the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. for though this City and that agree in ſome things, yet they differ in many; I ſhall ſhew you ſome difference between them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The gates of</hi> Ezekiels <hi>City, had no Angels to keep it in; but at the twelve gates of</hi> Johns <hi>City, there were twelve An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to keep them,</hi> Rev. 21.12.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Ezekiels <hi>City had all trees for meat, and medicine on both ſides of the banks of the River;</hi> Johns <hi>had one by the tree of life, which bears twelve manner of fruits,</hi> Rev. 22.2.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Ezekiels <hi>City was not half ſo great as</hi> Johns, <hi>the one being onely eighteen thouſand meaſures in compaſs, and the other twelve thouſand furlongs in length, breadth and height,</hi> Rev. 21.16.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Johns <hi>City had a Wall of twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles;</hi> Ezekiels <hi>City had a Wall,</hi> Chap. 40.5. <hi>but no names in it of Prophets or Apoſtles.</hi>

                     <p>By this City of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> I conceive is pointed out into us the glorious ſtate of the Chriſtian Church in the latter days; it hath been a long time ſaid to war under Antichriſt and his inſtruments, the breaches and ruines of it at this day are great, and the face of ſuch a City hardly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:47317:407"/> but when the times of Antichriſts deſtruction, and the Jews converſion do come, then ſhall this City be built, then ſhall Sion be in her glory; the Chriſtian Church ſhall be then in a greater glory then formerly. If the coming in of the Gentiles at firſt began the foundation of this City, what will the fulneſs of the Gentiles be when that is come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. but a glorious addition to this City? and then when the fulneſs of the Jews ſhall be added to the Chriſtian Church, to this City, what will that be but life from the dead? verſ 15.

Where the Temple, Altar and Worſhippers are meaſured; and its obſervable where there is mention of meaſuring, and ſo building a Temple, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is had unto the Jews; and the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days put for years are drawing to an end, and God is about ſome great things to be done in the world, and will ere long break forth.</p>
                     <p>That by this City is repreſented the Church, ſome Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins themſelves do acknowledge; for though they deny our Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, becauſe he never built them ſuch a Temple and City as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes; yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this City and Temple to be underſtood not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally or literally, but myſtically and ſpiritually: And the Talmudiſts affirm, <hi>That by Jeruſalem we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the gathering of the Gentiles to Chriſt, or the whole body of Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be ſeveral things obſervable concerning this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is well and ſtrongly founded; uſually Cities are built upon hills and mountains, which are the ſtrongeſt parts of the earth, and ſo was this City, <hi>chap.</hi> 40.2. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> ſaw the frame of this City upon a very high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and on ſuch a mountain is the Chriſtian Cfiurch built; on the mountain of Gods Decree and Power, on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Righteouſneſs and Truth; its built upon Chriſt the rock of ages; ſuch a rock as the gates of hell cannot ſhake
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:47317:407"/> or ſhatter. <hi>John</hi> tells us of this City the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it had twelve foundations, three on every ſquare, which were ſure, firm and would never fail: The Lord Chriſt, the holy Scriptures, and the Doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets and Apoſtles muſt fall to the ground before the Church ſhall be ruined, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is comely and beautiful; Cities which are built four ſquare eſpecially are ſo, and ſuch was this City, it had four thouſand and five hundred meaſures on each quarter; there was nothing unfightly on any of the four quarters, they were all parallel, and had gates alike in them, which preſented it very delightful to the eye; the Church of Chriſt is comely and beautiful; its built not of unhewen ſtones or timber, but ſuch as are well hewen and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid together. Hence the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is called <hi>Gods building,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. and the Church in general the <hi>City of the living God, Heb.</hi> 12.22. The Church is ſuch a building, ſuch a City as is full uf comelineſs and beauty; <hi>its a congregation of Saints, Pſal.</hi> 149.1. <hi>Its the garden of Chriſt,</hi> Cant. 4.12. <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.41. his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> whom himſelf ſaith is fair, <hi>yea the faireſt among women, Cant.</hi> 1.8. <hi>pleaſant,</hi> verſe 16. and <hi>beautiful</hi> 7.1. the <hi>Church is Chriſts body, Eph.</hi> 1.23. the <hi>Spirits Temple</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. and therefore hath curious work in it, very glorious and beautiful. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Sion,</hi> Pſal. 50.2. that it was <hi>the perfection of beauty,</hi> is moſt true of the Church under Chriſt and in Chriſt; its <hi>the perfection of beauty,</hi> Heb. 10.14. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The greatneſs and amplitude of this City; it had four thouſand and five hundred meaſures Eaſtward, Weſt, North and Southward; it was eighteen thouſand meaſures in compaſs, which ſets out the greatneſs and vaſt extent of the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.10. God ſaith he will bring the Jews from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and ſo multiply them that place ſhall not be found for them <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.20. <hi>The children ſhall ſay in thine ears,</hi> that is, in the ears of the

Jehovah <hi>ſhall be King over all the earth; and in that day there ſhall be one Lord,</hi> not many Lords, but one Lord, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.22.
